<i>The Lady of Kelpieshaw</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ALTHOUGH it was springtide by the
calendar, and already some little way
advanced, the snow time was by no means over
in that wild Border country. The exact date
was April 19. I fix it by the fact that my
birthday falls on the 18th, and that I spent
that one, the twenty-third, in an old-fashioned
hotel at Wooler, and celebrated it by treating
myself at dinner to the best bottle of wine the
house afforded. It may have been the bottle
of wine—but more likely it was sheer ignorance
and presumption—that prompted me
next morning to attempt what proved to be
an impossible feat of pedestrianism. I set
out immediately after breakfast intending before
nightfall to make a complete circuit of
the country which lies between Wooler and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
the Scottish border, going round by Kirknewton,
Coldburn, and the Cheviot, and getting
back to my starting-point by Hedgehope Hill
and Kelpie Strand. That would have been a
big walk on a long and fair summer day; in
the uncertainty of a northern April it was a
rash venture, which landed me in a highly unpleasant
situation before the close of the afternoon.
The morning was bright and promising,
and for many enjoyable hours all went
well. But about three o’clock came a disappearance
of the sun and a suspicious darkening
of the sky and lowering of temperature; before
long snow began to fall, and in a fashion with
which I, a Southerner, was not at all familiar.
It was thick, it was blinding, it was persistent;
it speedily obscured tracks, and heaped itself
up in hollows; I began to have visions of being
lost in it. And between five and six o’clock
I found myself in this position—as far as I
could make out from my pocket-map, I was
at some point of the Angle between the Cheviot,
Cairn Hill, and Hedgehope Hill and at
the western extremity of Harthope Burn, but
for all practical purposes I might as well have
been in the heart of the Andes. I could just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
make out the presence of the three great hills,
but I could see nothing of any farmstead or
dwelling; what was worse, no house, wayside
inn, or village was marked on my map—that
is, within any reasonable distance. As for a
path, I had already lost the one I was on, and
the snow by that time had become a smooth
thick white carpet in front of me; I might be
safe in stepping farther on that carpet, and I
might sink into a hole or bog and be unable to
get out. And the nearest indicated place—Middleton—was
miles and miles away, and
darkness was coming, and coming quickly.</p>

<p>The exact spot in which I made these rough
reckonings was at the lee side of a coppice of
young fir, whereat I had paused to rest a
while and to consider what was best to be
done. Clearly, there was only one thing to
do!—to struggle on and trust to luck. I prepared
for that by taking a pull at my flask, in
which, fortunately, there was still half its original
contents of whisky and water left, and
finishing the remains of my lunch. But the
prospect that faced me when I presently left
my shelter and rounded the corner of the coppice
was by no means pleasant. The snow was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
falling faster and thicker, and darkness was
surely coming. It looked as if I was either to
struggle through the snow for more miles than
I knew of, or be condemned to creep under
any shelter I could find and pass a miserable
night. But even then my bad luck was on the
turn. Going onward and downward, from off
the moorland towards the valley, I suddenly
realised that I had struck some sort of road
or made track; it was hard and wide, as I ascertained
by striking my stick through the
snow at various places. And just as suddenly,
a little way farther to the east, I saw, bright
and beckoning, the lights of a house.</p>

<p>The dusk was now so much fallen, and the
whirling snow-flakes so thick that I had come
right up to it before I could make out what
manner of house it was that I had chanced
upon so opportunely. It stood a little back
from the road, on its north side, and in a sort
of recess in the moorland, with the higher
ground shelving down to its walls on all sides
except that on which I stood. There was a
courtyard all round it; on three sides of this
the walls were unusually high, but on mine
lower—low enough to enable me to see what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
stood inside. And that was as queer-looking
a house as ever I had seen. Its centre was a
high, square tower, with a battlemented head;
from its west and east angles lower buildings
projected—lower, yet of considerable height;
at one of the angles of these wings, connecting
it and the tower, there was a round turret,
with a conical top—altogether the place was
so mediæval in appearance that it made me
think of marauding barons, cattle forays, and
all the rest of it. That the house was ancient I
gathered from one circumstance—there was
not a window anywhere in its lower parts.
These seemed to be of solid masonry, unpierced
by window or door; the lights I had
seen came from windows fifteen or twenty feet
above the level of the courtyard—one in the
round turret, one in the left wing, a third in
the right.</p>

<p>It was not until I was in the courtyard,
knee-deep in drifting snow, that I made out
where the door stood. It was at the foot of
the turret, and when I reached it, I saw that
it was in keeping with the rest of the place—a
stout oak affair, black with age, studded
with great square-headed iron nails, and set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
in a frame as sturdy as itself. It was one of
those doors which look, being shut, as if it
would never open, and when after a brief inspection
I beat loudly on its formidable timbers—no
bell being visible—it was with a wonder
as to whether such a feeble summons
would carry through that evident thickness.</p>

<p>But the great door swung back almost at
once. There, before me, a lamp held above her
head, stood an elderly woman, a tall, gaunt,
hard-featured woman, who first started with
obvious surprise at seeing me, and then stared
at me with equally apparent suspicion. There
was no friendliness in her face, and the lack of
it drove out of my head whatever it was that
I had meant to say. But I managed to stammer
an inquiry.</p>

<p>“Oh—er—can you tell me where I am?” I
said. “I mean—what is the nearest village, or
inn? I’m making my way to Wooler,
and——”</p>

<p>It seemed to me that the door was about to
be closed in my face; certainly the woman narrowed
the already small opening between us.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing’ll be nearer than Middleton,”
she answered, “and you’ll keep straight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
on the road outside, and that’ll be maybe six
miles.”</p>

<p>“Six miles—in this snow!” I exclaimed.
“I’ll be——”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing nearer,” she made haste to
say. “There’s no house at all between this and
Middleton. And I’d advise you to be getting
along, for the snow’ll be far worse ere the
night’s fallen than what it is, and the road
is not——”</p>

<p>The voice of a girl, clear, musical, and with
a touch of masterfulness in it, broke in on the
woman’s harsh accents.</p>

<p>“Tibbie! What is it?—who is there?”</p>

<p>The woman frowned. But—involuntarily—she
opened the door wider. I saw then that
she was standing in a square stone hall of very
small dimensions, and that from her right hand
stone steps, obviously set in a newel stair, gave
access to the upper regions of this queer old
place. And I saw more—I saw a pair of slim
and shapely ankles, in smart stockings and
shoes; the edge of a dainty skirt, and the projection
of the stair out of all else.</p>

<p>“It’s a young man, miss, wants to know his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
way,” said the janitor. “He’s for Wooler,
and I’ve told him——”</p>

<p>“For Wooler? In this snow? Impossible,
Tibbie! Why——”</p>

<p>The smart shoes suddenly tripped down the
stair. Before I could realise my luck their
owner was confronting me with curiosity and
interest. I suppose I looked pretty forlorn
and tramp-like; my water-proof coat was none
of the newest, and I was wearing a disreputable,
favourite old hat. But I uncovered and
made my best bow. And if I stared it was because
the light of the old woman’s lamp
showed me the prettiest girl I had ever had the
good fortune to see. Perhaps, because we
were both young, I made bold to smile at her—knowingly.</p>

<p>“You think I shall be—lost in the snow and
found dead in the morning?” I suggested.</p>

<p>“That’s precisely what you will be if you try
to reach Wooler to-night,” she answered, with
some liveliness. “Such a thing’s impossible!
even if you knew the way, and I think you
don’t. Of course, you must stay here. My
guardian, Mr. Parslewe, is out, but——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>“The master is not one for strangers, miss,”
interrupted the old woman. “His orders——”</p>

<p>The girl turned on her with a flash of her
grey eyes that gave me a good notion of her
imperious temper and general masterfulness.</p>

<p>“Fiddle-de-dee, Tibbie!” she exclaimed.
“Your master would have a good deal to say
if we turned anybody from his door on a night
like this. You must come in,” she went on,
turning smilingly to me. “Mr. Parslewe is
the most hospitable man alive, and if he were
in he’d welcome you heartily. I don’t know
whether he’ll manage to get home to-night or
not. But I’m at home!” she concluded with
a sudden glint in her eye. “Come up the
stair!”</p>

<p>I waited for no second invitation. She was
already tripping up the stair, holding her
skirts daintily away from the grey stone wall,
and I hastened to follow. We climbed some
twenty steps, the old woman following with
her lamp; then we emerged upon another and
larger hall, stone-walled like that below, and
ornamented with old pikes, muskets, broadswords,
foxes’ masks; two doors, just then
thrown wide, opened from it; one revealed a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
great kitchen place in which an old man sat
near a huge fire, the other admitted to a big,
cosy parlour, wherein the firelight was dancing
on panelled walls.</p>

<p>“Take off your things and give them to Tibbie,”
commanded my hostess. “And, Tibbie—tea!
At once. Now come in,” she went on,
leading me into the parlour, “and if you’d like
whisky until the tea comes, there it is, on the
sideboard. Have some!”</p>

<p>“Thank you, but I’ve just had a dose,” I
answered. “I had some in my flask, very fortunately.
You are extremely kind to be so
hospitable.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” she laughed. “You couldn’t
turn a dog out on a night like this. I don’t
know if my guardian will manage to get
home—he and his old pony can do wonders,
and they’ve sometimes got through when the
drifts were two or three feet thick. But you’re
all right—sit down.”</p>

<p>She pointed to a big arm-chair near the fire,
and I obeyed her and dropped into it—to
make a more leisurely inspection of my surroundings,
and my hostess. The room was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
evidently a part of the square tower I had seen
from without, and filled a complete story of
it; there were two high windows in it, filled
with coloured glass; the panelling all round
was of some dark wood, old and time-stained;
the furniture was in keeping; there were old
pictures, old silver and brass, old books—it
was as if I had suddenly dropped into a
setting of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>But the girl was modern enough. She
seemed to be about nineteen or twenty years
old. She was tallish, slenderish, graceful; her
hair was brown, her eyes grey, her face bright
with healthy colour. I thought it probable that
she spent most of her life out of doors, and I
pictured her in tweeds and strong shoes,
tramping the hills. But just then she was
very smart in indoor things, and I was thankful
that I myself, now that my outer wrappings
had been discarded, was wearing a new
suit, and looked rather more respectable than
when I knocked at the door.</p>

<p>There was a lamp on the table, recently
lighted, and the girl turned up the wick, and
as its glow increased turned and looked at me,
more narrowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“You’re a stranger, aren’t you?” she said.
“You don’t belong to these parts?”</p>

<p>“Quite a stranger,” I answered, “or I
shouldn’t have been so foolish as to attempt
what I was attempting.” I gave her a brief
account of what I had been after. “So you
see how lucky I am to be saved, as you have
saved me! And please allow me to introduce
myself—my name’s Alvery Craye, and I come
from London.”</p>

<p>“London!” she exclaimed, wonderingly.
“Where I have never been! My name—you’ll
think it a curious one—is Madrasia—Madrasia
Durham. Did you ever hear such a queer
name as Madrasia?”</p>

<p>“Never!” said I. “How did you get it?”</p>

<p>“Born in Madras,” she answered. “My
father was a merchant there. Mr. Parslewe,
my guardian, with whom I live here, was his
partner. They died—my father and mother,
I mean—when I was little, so Mr. Parslewe
has looked after me ever since. We came to
England three years ago, and Mr. Parslewe
bought this old place, and fitted it up. Do
you like it?”</p>

<p>“From what I’ve seen of it, immensely,” I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
answered. “What is it, exactly—or, rather,
what has it been?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Parslewe says it was a sixteenth-century
peel tower—a sort of castle, you know,”
she answered. “There are a good many here
and there, on each side of the Tweed. We
stayed for some time at Berwick when we
came to England, looking round for an old
place. Then we found this, and settled down.
It’s delightful in summer, and in winter it’s
weird!”</p>

<p>“Has it a name?” I asked. “Because it’s
not marked on my map.”</p>

<p>“Name?—Yes!” she answered. “It’s called
Kelpieshaw—that’s Kelpie Strand, that lies
outside it, between Langlee Crags and
Hedgehope Hill. But you’ll see more in the
morning—if the storm’s cleared.”</p>

<p>The old woman came in with the tea-tray.
Whether she resented my presence or not, she
knew her duties, and her home-made cakes
were as good as her face was stern.</p>

<p>“That’s our sole domestic,” observed my
hostess, as she poured out the tea. “Tibbie
Muir: she’s been with us ever since we came
here. The old man you saw in the kitchen is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
her husband, Edie Muir. He’s a sort of useful
adjunct. He grooms the pony, potters about
the house, and nods over the fire. He’s very
little to do, but Tibbie is a marvel of activity.”</p>

<p>“I hope she’ll forgive me for coming,” I
said.</p>

<p>“Oh, her bark is worse than her bite! She’s
one of the faithful servants you read about in
books and rarely meet in real life. She’s under
the impression that if Mr. Parslewe happens
not to be at home it’s her duty to be on
guard. I believe she thinks of me as a mere
child. But I’m mistress, of course!”</p>

<p>“I hope Mr. Parslewe will not think me an
intruder?” I suggested. “I suppose I could
have struggled through.”</p>

<p>“And I suppose you couldn’t,” she retorted
imperatively. “As for Mr. Parslewe, he’ll be
delighted to see you. If you can talk to him
about anything old—old books, or pictures,
old pots, pans, and plates, he’ll be more than
delighted.”</p>

<p>I glanced round the room. It was one of
those rooms which are difficult to light—there
were dark and shadowy places and recesses.
But I could see cabinets and presses, shelves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
and cases, evidently full of the sort of things
of which Miss Durham had just spoken; there
was also, on my left hand, a massive sideboard,
covered with what looked to me like old silver.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Parslewe a collector, then?” I
asked. “Or is he an antiquary?”</p>

<p>“A bit of both, I think,” she answered, as
she handed me a tea-cup. “Anyway, he’s
always bringing home some curiosity or other
that he’s picked up. And he spends most of
his time reading his old books—there’s a room
higher in the tower full of books—big things
that one can scarcely lift.”</p>

<p>“And how do you spend your time?” I inquired.
“Not that way?”</p>

<p>She shook her head, laughing.</p>

<p>“That way?” she said. “No!—not yet, anyway;
I’ll leave that sort of thing till I’m old
and frumpy. No, I spend my time out of
doors mostly. A bit of fishing, a bit of running
after the beagles, and a good bit of shooting.
We have the shooting round about; it’s
rough shooting, but good.”</p>

<p>“You’re a regular Diana,” I remarked.
“And Mr. Parslewe, does he go in for sport?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” she replied. “Sometimes he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
goes fishing, and now and then he’ll carry a
gun. But he usually becomes meditative over
a stream, and is generally looking somewhere
else if anything gets up in front of his gun,
so his performances don’t amount to much.”
She laughed again, and then looked half-archly,
half-inquisitively at me.</p>

<p>“I’m wondering what you do with yourself,”
she said.</p>

<p>“I? Oh! I paint a bit,” I answered.</p>

<p>“So, sometimes, does my guardian,” she remarked.
“He calls it daubing, but they aren’t
bad. There are two of his works of art on that
panel.”</p>

<p>She pointed to two small water-colour
sketches which, framed in gilt, hung in a recess
near the hearth. I rose and looked at
them. One was of the house, the other a view
of the Cheviot. There was some feeling of
performance in both.</p>

<p>“What do you think of them?” she asked.
“Perhaps you’re a swell hand at that sort of
thing?”</p>

<p>“Very nice,” I replied. “And interesting,
to me. My reason for wandering round to-day
was that I wanted to find a good subject. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
think I’ve found one, this place. I could make
a good picture of it, with the hills as the background.”</p>

<p>“Do, do!” she exclaimed. “And I’ll make
my guardian buy it from you; he often buys
pictures. You might put me in it, with my
gun and my dogs; I’ll show you the dogs in
the morning—beauties!”</p>

<p>We got on very well together, chatting in
this light-hearted fashion. The evening passed
on, but Mr. Parslewe did not come. We had
supper; still he did not come. And at ten
o’clock my hostess pronounced a decision.</p>

<p>“He won’t come to-night, now,” she said.
“And it’s my bed-time. Tibbie will take
charge of you, Mr. Craye, and I can promise
you that your bed is properly aired. Don’t
be afraid of the room; it looks as if it were
haunted, but it isn’t.”</p>

<p>She gave me her hand, smiled, and went off,
and presently the old woman appeared and
conducted me to a chamber in one of the wings.
It was more mediæval in appearance than the
parlour, but it was remarkably comfortable,
and there were hot bottles in the bed.</p>

<p>I believe I fell asleep as soon as my head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
fairly settled on the pillow, and at once
dropped into a sound slumber. I have no
idea as to what time it was during the night
when I woke suddenly and sharply, to find
a man standing at my bedside, and, by the light
of a bull’s-eye lantern, looking down on me
with a half-shrewd, half-whimsical expression.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">II<br>

<i>The Second Stranger</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I&#8202; SAT straight up in bed, blinking at the
light and its holder. Half-asleep though
I was, I got an impression of my visitor. An
ascetic-looking, clean-shaven man, with a big,
well-shaped nose, and firm thin lips, which, in
unison with a pair of keen, observant eyes,
could, as I found out later, assume various expressions,
changing from intense disagreeableness
to peculiar sweetness. Just then eyes
and lips were quite agreeable—in fact, their
owner laughed gently.</p>

<p>“All right, young master!” he said, in a
voice as sweet and mellow as his smile. “Fall
to your sleep again—I only just wanted to
see what strange bird we’d got in our roost.”</p>

<p>He laughed again and made for the door.
I found my voice.</p>

<p>“Mr. Parslewe?” I asked interrogatively.</p>

<p>“At your service, sir,” he answered, with a
sort of mock politeness. “James Parslewe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>“I hope I’m not——” I began.</p>

<p>“Are you warm enough?” he inquired, suddenly
stepping back to the bedside and laying
a hand on its coverings. “It’s a gey cold
night, and I’m thinking you’re not of these
parts.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m warm enough indeed, thank you,”
I assured him. “Couldn’t be more comfortable,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Then go to sleep again,” he commanded,
with another of his half-jesting, half-cynical
laughs. “You’re heartily welcome to my
ancient roof.”</p>

<p>He went away then, quietly closing the door
behind him, and I obeyed his behest and fell
asleep again. Nor did I awake until the old
man that I had seen by the kitchen fire the
night before appeared in my room, bringing
me hot water, shaving tackle, tea. He drew
back curtains and blinds, and I saw that the
sky was still grey and heavy.</p>

<p>“More snow in the night?” I asked him.</p>

<p>He started, as if unused to being spoken
to, and nodded his old head.</p>

<p>“Aye, there’ll have been a deal more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
snow, master,” he answered. “Many feet
deep it is all round the house.”</p>

<p>I got up, drank the tea, made as careful a
toilet as I could, and eventually went off to the
room in the tower wherein I had spent the
evening with my youthful hostess. It was so
far untenanted, but there was a great fire of
logs blazing in the big open hearth, and the
breakfast table was laid before it; from the adjacent
kitchen came highly appetizing odours.
I warmed myself at the hearth, looking round;
now, in the morning light, dull though it was,
I could see the room better. It was easy to
get from it an idea of its owner’s tastes—the
beautiful old furniture, the panelling, the arrangement
of the cabinets and their contents,
all showed the inclination and love of the collector,
who was also a good judge of what he
collected. There were many things of great
interest in that room—one struck me particularly,
perhaps because the fire flames kept
glinting sharply on its burnished front. This
was a small copper box, a thing some six or
seven inches square, which stood in the middle
of the ancient sideboard, one out of many curious
articles placed there. I could see, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
where I stood, that it was a bit of unusually
good work, and I presently went closer and
took it into my hands. Anything worked in
old brass or copper had always appealed to
me; this quaint little coffer, or chest, beautifully
elegant in its severe simplicity, took my
fancy. It was a plain thing throughout, except
that on the lid was engraven a coat-of-arms,
and on the scroll beneath it a legend—</p>

<p class="center"><i>Thatte I please I wylle.</i></p>

<p>I had just replaced the copper box and was
turning away wondering what these words
signified when I caught sight of something
which I had certainly not expected to see.
There, hung in two panels above the sideboard,
obscured in shadow the previous evening
but plain enough now, as they faced the big
window, hung two small pictures of my own,
water-colour sketches of scenery in Teesdale
which I had shown at the Royal Academy a
year before and had subsequently sold to a
Bond Street dealer. I was looking at them
when Miss Durham came in, followed by the
old woman and the breakfast dishes.</p>

<p>Miss Durham and I shook hands solemnly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
Then we both smiled, and eventually laughed.
She nodded at a door in the corner of the
room.</p>

<p>“Mr. Parslewe came after all,” she said.</p>

<p>“I’m aware of it,” said I. “He came to see
me—some time or other.”</p>

<p>“No?” she exclaimed. “What for?”</p>

<p>“Wanted to know if I’d enough blankets,
I think,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope you had!” she said. “Had you?
But how——”</p>

<p>Just then the door in the corner opened and
my host entered. I saw then that he was a
rather tall, loose-limbed man of probably fifty-five
to sixty, with a remarkably intellectual
face, sphinx-like in expression, and as I have
already said, capable of looking almost fiendishly
disagreeable or meltingly sweet. It was
sweet enough now as he came forward, offering
me his hand with old-fashioned courtesy.</p>

<p>“Good morning, master!” he cooed—no
other word expresses his suavity of tone. “I
trust you slept well and refreshingly after all
your privations.”</p>

<p>“My privations, sir, had been of short duration,
and their recompense full,” I replied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
imitating his half-chaffing tone. “I slept
excellently well, thank you.”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s a blessing!” he said, rubbing
his hands. “So did I!”</p>

<p>“It was very unkind of you, though, Jimmie,
to wake up a guest in the middle of the
night,” said Miss Durham. “How inconsiderate!”</p>

<p>Mr. Parslewe motioned me to the breakfast
table with a bow and a wave of his delicately
fingered hand, and favoured his ward and myself
with one of his sweetest smiles.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know, my dear,” he retorted.
“He might have been a burglar!—you never
can tell.”</p>

<p>He laughed, with full enjoyment, at his
own joke, and bent towards me as he handed
me a plate.</p>

<p>“I was sorry I woke you!” he said, still
smiling. “I was enjoying looking at you. I
thought I’d never seen such a refreshingly innocent
young mortal in my life! In fact, I
was just thinking of fetching Madrasia to look
at you when you woke.”</p>

<p>He laughed more than ever at this, and I
glanced from him to his ward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“Don’t mind him!” she said. “That’s his
way. He possesses a curious form of humour—a
very twisted form sometimes. You’re a
queer man, Jimmie, aren’t you? And I gave
you such a splendid character last night!—said
that you’d have been furious if I hadn’t
insisted on bringing Mr. Craye in, and lots
more—didn’t I, Mr. Craye?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d certainly rather see him sitting
there alive, eating his bacon, than dig him out
of the snow, dead,” remarked Mr. Parslewe,
good-humouredly. “But Craye, now—do you
happen to be related to Craye, the landscape
painter?”</p>

<p>“I am Craye, the landscape painter, Mr.
Parslewe,” I replied. “That’s why I’m in this
neighbourhood. I was looking out all yesterday
for a likely subject.”</p>

<p>His face lighted up with genuine pleasure,
and he stretched out his hand across the table
and shook mine heartily.</p>

<p>“Man!” he exclaimed, “I’m delighted to
have you in my house! You’re a clever young
fellow; I’ve admired your work ever since I
was first privileged to see it. And bought it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
too; there’s two water-colours of yours behind
you there, and——”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen them,” said I.</p>

<p>“And I’ve two more upstairs in my study,”
he continued. “Aye, well, I’m greatly
pleased! And you’re staying in these parts?”</p>

<p>“I came to the hotel at Wooler three days
ago, just to look round the Cheviots,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Any definite time?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” said I. “I’m my own master as to
that.”</p>

<p>“Then when old Edie can get through the
snow, we’ll just send across to Wooler for
your things, and you’ll consider this house
yours, Mr. Craye,” he said, with a nod of his
head which implied that he would take no refusal.
“Your very obedient servant, sir, as
long as you like to stop in it!”</p>

<p>“There!” exclaimed Miss Durham; “I knew
you’d get on together like a house on fire! But
perhaps Mr. Craye thinks he might be dull?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Craye thinks nothing of the sort,” I
retorted hastily. “He’s overwhelmed on all
sides. You’re extremely kind, Mr. Parslewe;
your sense of hospitality is princely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>“Pooh, pooh!” he said. “We’ll just be glad.
And there’s no need to be dull, my girl, when
you’re about!” he added, nodding at his ward.
“A lively damsel, this, Craye; the air of the
hills is in her blood!”</p>

<p>“Miss Durham, sir, is, I am sure, one of
those admirable hostesses who could never let
a guest be anything but happy,” I said, with
a glance towards the object of my compliment.
“And,” I added, more seriously, “I should be
very ungrateful not to accept your kind invitation.
I won’t let you get tired of me.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Craye thinks he could paint a picture
of the house, with the hills for a background,
Jimmie,” remarked Miss Durham. “You’d
buy that, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Hoots, toots! We’ll see, woman, we’ll
see!” answered Mr. Parslewe. “There’s finer
subjects than this old place, but you’ll not see
them to-day, my lad,” he added, turning to me.
“The snow’s thick and deep all round our walls,
and what you’ll see of the land for the next
twenty-four hours, and maybe more, ’ll be
from the top of our tower. And a grand observation
post it is, too!”</p>

<p>He took me up the tower after breakfast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
was over. From the leads at its battlemented
head there was a wonderful view of the surrounding
country; he indicated the chief features
as we stood there, looking out on the
snow-clad expanse. And I saw then what I
had not been able to see the night before, that
this place, Kelpieshaw, was absolutely isolated;
as far as I could see, on any side, there
was not even a shepherd’s hut or gamekeeper’s
lodge in view.</p>

<p>“You love solitude, Mr. Parslewe,” I remarked
as I looked about me. “This, surely,
is solitude!”</p>

<p>“Aye, it is!” he agreed. “And it suits me.
What’s more to the purpose, it suits my ward—up
to now, anyway. When I brought her
from India, where she was born, I looked
about for a likely place in this district. We
came across this—half-ruinous it was then.
I bought it, did it up, furnished it, got a lot
of things here that I’d left stored in London
when I first went to India, many a year ago,
and settled down. The girl loves it—and so
do I.”</p>

<p>He gave me one of his half-serious, half-sardonic
smiles, and we went down the stair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
again, and into a big room, a floor above the
parlour, wherein he kept his books and his collections.
It was something of a cross between
a museum and a library, and I could see that
he was remarkably proud of the things in it.
I saw, too, that my host was a man of means—only
a well-to-do man could have afforded
to bring together the things that he had there.
Like all antiquaries he began to point out to
me his chief treasures, and to talk about them,
and finding that I had some knowledge of
such things, to dig into old chests and presses
in order to unearth others. Once, while he was
thus engaged, I was looking at some small
volumes bound in old calf which were ranged
in one of the recesses; once more, on the side
of one of these, in faded gilt, I came across the
arms and legend which I had noticed on the
copper box in the room below; he looked up
from his task to find me regarding it.</p>

<p>“An odd motto that, Mr. Parslewe,” I observed.
“I noticed it on your old copper
chest, or coffer, downstairs, ‘That I please, I
will!’ What does it mean?” He laughed
satirically.</p>

<p>“I should say it means that the folk who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
sported it were pretty much inclined to have
their own way, my lad!” he answered.
“Whether they got it or not is another question.
Now, here’s a fifteenth-century Book
of Hours, with the illuminations as fresh as
when they were done. Look you there for a
bit of fine work!”</p>

<p>I had meant to ask him whose coat-of-arms
and whose legend it was that had excited my
curiosity, but I saw that the subject either
possessed no interest for him or that he didn’t
want to be questioned about it, and I turned
to what he was showing me. We spent most
of that morning examining his collection, and
we got on together admirably. Still, I was
not sorry when Miss Durham appeared and
insisted on dragging me away from him to go
out with her into the courtyard to inspect her
horse, her dogs, and other live creatures. The
old man had cleared much of the courtyard of
snow, but beyond its walls the drifts were
deep. From the gate I looked across them
with a certain amount of impatience—I
wanted to see more of the country, and I had
notions that Miss Durham might not be unwilling
to act as guide to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“Don’t think you’re going to be a prisoner
for very long,” she suddenly remarked, interpreting
my silent contemplation of the vast
waste of whiteness. “At this time of the year
the snow goes quickly. You needn’t be surprised
if you find it vanished when you wake
to-morrow, thick as it is.”</p>

<p>“If it is, and we can get out, you’ll show me
some of your favourite scenes?” I suggested.
“I could make a sketch or two.”</p>

<p>“Of course!” she assented. “There’s a lovely
bit along the road towards Roddam. I’ll take
you there as soon as the snow’s gone; you’ll
be ravished with it!”</p>

<p>We had three days’ wait for that, and during
that time, as if they felt themselves bound
to compensate me for the delay, my host and
hostess did all they could to amuse and interest
me, though, to tell the truth, I was interested
enough in them personally, and needed
no other diversion. Mr. Parslewe was certainly
a character, full of eccentricities, with a
strong sense of humour, and a mordant wit;
he had evidently seen much of men and of
the world, and his comments on things in
general were as interesting as they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
amusing. I made out, however, that his
knowledge of our own country and our own
period was considerably out of date; he appeared
to know little of present-day affairs,
though he had a fine old store of anecdotes of a
previous generation. But a chance remark of
his accounted for this.</p>

<p>“I left England for India and the East
when I was twenty-one,” he said to me one
evening in casual conversation, “and I never
saw its shores again until I’d turned fifty.
And now that I’m back—and some years, too—I
don’t want to see any more of it than I
can see from the top of my dear old tower!
Here I am, and here I stick!”</p>

<p>I wondered if he meant his young and
pretty ward to stick there, too—but those
were early days to put the question to him.
Still, by that time I had fallen in love with
Madrasia; it would have been a most unheard-of
thing if I hadn’t! And already I
meant to move all the powers that are in
heaven and earth to win her—for which reason
I was devoutly thankful when, on the
fourth day of my stay, winter suddenly disappeared
as if by magic, and springtide again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
asserted itself and flooded the hills and valleys
with warmth and sunshine. For then she and
I got out of the old house, leaving Mr. Parslewe
with his books and papers, and began to
wander abroad, improving our acquaintance—very
pleasantly and successfully. There
had been a comforting air of romance about
our meeting which, I think, appealed to both
of us; it was still there, making an atmosphere
around us, and now the elements of a most
puzzling and curious mystery were to be
added to it.</p>

<p>Those elements were first introduced by a
man who came along the road leading from
Wooperton and Roddam, and chanced to find
Madrasia and myself sitting on a shelf of rock
by its side, I doing a bit of perfunctory
sketching, and she watching me. He was a
tourist-looking sort of man; that is to say, he
wore the sort of garments affected by tourists;
otherwise, I should have said that he was
perhaps a commercial traveller, or a well-to-do
tradesman who loved country walks—a biggish,
well-fed, florid-faced man, shrewd of eye,
and, as we presently discovered, very polite—too
polite—of manner. He regarded us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
closely as he came up, and when he was abreast
of us, he stopped in the centre of the road and
lifted his cap; it was the latest thing in head-gear
of that sort, and he raised it with something
of a flourish.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he said, with a deprecating,
ingratiating smile. “Can you tell me
if, somewhere in this neighbourhood, there is
a house called Kelpieshaw?”</p>

<p>It was Madrasia who answered—promptly.</p>

<p>“Two miles ahead, along the valley,” she
said. “Can’t miss it.”</p>

<p>The man bowed, and smiled again; a little
too obsequiously, I thought.</p>

<p>“The residence of, I believe—er, Mr. Parslewe?”
he suggested. “Mr. James Parslewe.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Parslewe lives there,” assented Madrasia.
“Want him?”</p>

<p>He smiled again—enigmatically this time.</p>

<p>“I hope to have the pleasure of waiting
upon Mr. Parslewe—and of finding him at
home,” he answered. “Er—Mr. Parslewe, I
believe—perhaps you are acquainted with
him?—is a gentleman learned in—er, antiquities—and
that sort of thing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“He is a bit inclined that way,” replied
Madrasia, almost flippantly. “Are you?”</p>

<p>He waved his hand, shelving away from us.</p>

<p>“A neophyte—a mere neophyte,” he said,
still smiling. “A—er, learner!”</p>

<p>He strode off up the valley: we looked after
him meditatively.</p>

<p>“Don’t like the looks of that person,” said
Madrasia, suddenly.</p>

<p>“Neither do I—though I don’t know why,”
I answered. “Case of Dr. Fell, I suppose.
Bit too given to smiling readily, eh?”</p>

<p>“Oily!” said Madrasia. “Wonder who he
is—and what he’s after?”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t look like a dry-as-dust antiquary,
anyhow,” I remarked.</p>

<p>But whatever the man looked like, we found
him with Parslewe when we went home—one
on each side of the parlour fire. And Parslewe
introduced him, unceremoniously—Mr.
Pawley.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span></p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">III<br>

<i>Copper</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MR. PAWLEY, who looked very comfortable
in an easy chair, with a glass
of whisky and soda conveniently at hand,
smiled upon us as if we were old acquaintances.
He was clearly one of those gentlemen
who speedily make themselves at home
anywhere, and, as it presently appeared, are
by no means backward in the art of finding
things out. Indeed, he at once began to put
leading questions.</p>

<p>“Your daughter, I presume, sir?” he suggested,
with a glance at Madrasia.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it!” answered Parslewe, in his
most off-hand manner. “My ward.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, sir! now I could have thought
that I saw a distinct family resemblance,”
said Mr. Pawley. “This young gentleman,
perhaps——”</p>

<p>“Visitor of mine,” replied Parslewe. “Mr.
Craye—a well-known artist.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>“Pleased to meet you, sir,” murmured Mr.
Pawley. “I observed that you were doing
something in your line when I saw you and
Miss—I didn’t catch the young lady’s name,
I think—Miss——?”</p>

<p>“Durham!” said Parslewe. “Durham!”</p>

<p>“Just so, sir—Miss Durham. Ah!—and a
very pleasant country this is, Mr. Craye, for
your form of art—and very delightful quarters,
I’m sure,” added Mr. Pawley, with a
bow towards our host. “And you were saying,
Mr. Parslewe——?”</p>

<p>Madrasia, with an odd glance at me, went
out of the room, and Parslewe, who, I thought,
already looked bored to death by his visitor,
turned to him.</p>

<p>“I was saying that if you’re really interested
in that sort of thing—barrows and stone
circles and so on, I’m scarcely the man to come
to,” he said. “My tastes lie more chiefly in
books. If you’re going to stay in the district
a while, I can give you a list of titles of books—local
and otherwise—that you can read up.
I think you’d find all of them in the various
libraries at Newcastle.”</p>

<p>“That’s very kind of you, Mr. Parslewe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
I’m sure,” replied Mr. Pawley. “I should
value that, sir.”</p>

<p>Parslewe rose from his chair and left the
room. I heard him climb the stair to his
library on the next floor of the tower. Mr.
Pawley looked at me. It was a peculiarly
scrutinising, appraising glance—it gave me an
idea that the man was wondering how much
he could get out of me in the way of information.</p>

<p>“A very clever and learned gentleman, Mr.
Parslewe,” he observed. “Uncommon!”</p>

<p>“I agree!” said I.</p>

<p>“Makes a man like me—just beginning to
take an interest in these things, do you see—feel
that he knows—ah, nothing!” he said.</p>

<p>“I quite understand you,” I assented.</p>

<p>“And what a—yes, you might call it—wealth
of curiosities he’s gathered about him,” he continued.
“Odds and ends of all sorts. Now,
there’s an object that’s attracted my attention—a
very pretty article!”</p>

<p>He rose suddenly, and walking across to the
sideboard, picked up the copper box, holding
it to the light, and examining it with exaggerated
admiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“Beautiful bit of work, Mr.—Craye, I
think—beautiful!” he said, unctuously. “Not
made yesterday, that, sir. Old coat-of-arms,
you see, and a motto. Um! You don’t happen
to know whose family coat-of-arms that
is, Mr. Craye?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” said I. “Do you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, no! as I remarked—when I saw
you and the young lady down the road—I’m
a learner, a novice, a neophyte, Mr. Craye,”
he replied. “Fine coat-of-arms, though, that—and
a peculiar motto. Now what would
you take those words to signify, Mr. Craye?”</p>

<p>Before I could reply, we heard Parslewe
coming back, and Mr. Pawley hastily put
down the copper box and retreated to his
chair, for all the world as if he had been
caught or been about to be caught in the act
of stealing something.</p>

<p>“These antiquaries!” he murmured, with
a cautioning wink at me, “I know ’em!—they
don’t like their treasures handled. Precious!
Old pots—worth sixpence to some people—worth
their weight in gold, to them. Just
so!”</p>

<p>Parslewe came into the room with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
sheet of notepaper in his hand; Mr. Pawley
received it with gratitude as exaggerated as
his admiration of the copper box. And presently
he said that he must now be moving; I
am sure it was with a desire to speed his departure
that Parslewe offered to show him
down the stair and to point out a short cut
across the moor. So they vanished, and when
Parslewe came back the tea-tray had just been
brought in and Madrasia was busy at it. She
turned on her guardian as he entered.</p>

<p>“Jimmie!” she exclaimed. “Who on earth
was that creature?”</p>

<p>Parslewe laughed as he dropped into his
favourite chair.</p>

<p>“No more idea than you have, my dear!”
he answered. “Introduced himself as a
humble fellow-labourer in the same field, in
which—so he said—I’m a past master. Said
he was holidaying in the neighbourhood, and
had heard of me, so ventured to call and see
me. Wanted to know if there were any
objects worthy of his attention round about
here—sepulchral things and so on. The odd
thing,” continued Parslewe, with one of his
sardonic laughs, “the very odd thing was that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
I never saw a man who looked less like an
antiquary in my life!”</p>

<p>“Or talked less like one, I should think,”
suggested Madrasia.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’d picked up a few cant phrases,
somewhere or other,” observed Parslewe.</p>

<p>“He told me that he’d turned to this sort of
thing, as he called it, for a hobby—a man, he
observed, with the air of one uttering a hitherto-undiscovered
truth, must have something
to do. Ha-hah-hah!”</p>

<p>“He seems to have amused you, anyway,”
remarked Madrasia.</p>

<p>“Aye!—why not?” assented Parslewe.
“Of course he did; I thought he looked much
more at home with a glass in his hand and a
pipe in his mouth than he would amongst
either books or barrows.”</p>

<p>“Well, really, I wondered whatever brought
him here!” said Madrasia. “A neophyte, indeed!—in
loud tweeds and a glaring necktie.
I thought he was a sporting publican out for
a walk.”</p>

<p>I did not say what I thought. The fact
was I had some queer suspicions about Mr.
Pawley. I had noticed his odd, shrewd,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
examining glances; he looked to me like a
man who has an object, a mission; who is
spying out the land; endeavouring to get at
a discovery. That he had some purpose in
view I was sure, but I said nothing to Parslewe
and Madrasia. Just then we had a more
pertinent and interesting matter to discuss.</p>

<p>Parslewe wanted me to stay there a while
and to paint a landscape for him. He had
a favourite view, near the house, and was
keenly anxious that somebody should do justice
to it—moreover, he wanted the picture to
be painted in the freshness of springtide,
though my own private inclination would have
led me to paint it in the autumn. And he had
offered me a handsome price for it, agreeing,
too, that I should be allowed to submit it for
the next Royal Academy exhibition. I was
by no means unwilling to accept his offer, for
apart from the advantages of the commission,
the work meant spending at least a month or
six weeks at Kelpieshaw—in the society of
Madrasia. And I had already fallen in love
with Madrasia.</p>

<p>We settled the affair of the picture over
that tea-table. I decided to start on it at once,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
and the first thing then was to get a suitable
canvas. Parslewe said I should be sure to
find one in Newcastle, and I arranged to
journey there next day, seek out an artist’s
colourman, and buy what I wanted. On this
errand I was in Newcastle about noon on the
following morning, and the first person I saw
there was our recent visitor, the somewhat
mysterious Mr. Pawley.</p>

<p>Mr. Pawley did not see me. I caught
sight of him by accident, but, having seen
him, I made it my business to watch him a
little. He stood at the exit of one of the
arrival platforms, and he was absorbed in
looking for somebody or other. An express
came in from the south; its passengers began
to stream through the exit; presently Mr.
Pawley—who was still attired as when I had
last seen him—removed his cap and bowed
with sincere obsequiousness. The object of
his reverence was an elderly, big-framed, very
consequential-looking man, whose large face
was ornamented by a pair of old-fashioned
whiskers, and who, in my opinion, had family
solicitor written big all over himself and his
attire, from his silk hat to his stout-soled,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
gaitered, square-toed boots. That he was a
person of much greater importance than Mr.
Pawley was very evident from the fact that
he replied to Mr. Pawley’s obsequious greeting
with a mere condescending nod, and at
once resigned into his hands a Gladstone bag
and a travelling rug. There was an interchange
of brief remarks between the two—then
they marched across the platform to
the hotel and vanished within its portals, the
large man going first, and Mr. Pawley playing
porter behind.</p>

<p>My curiosity had been aroused so keenly
by that time that I had some absurd notion
of following Pawley and the white-whiskered
person into the hotel, just to see if I could
find out a little more about their mutual
relation. But on reflection I went off about
my own business. Having some knowledge
of Newcastle, I walked up town to a certain
restaurant of which I knew and highly
approved; there I lunched and idled an hour
away afterwards. After that I set out in
quest of a firm whose name Parslewe had
given me. Its manager had not got a canvas
of the precise size I wanted, but he promised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
to make me one by noon of the following
day, and I accordingly decided to stay in
Newcastle for the night, and, later, went to
the hotel at the station to book a room. In the
smoking-room there, writing letters, was
the white-whiskered person. Pawley was not
with him. Nor was Pawley with him when,
after dinner that evening, he came into the
smoking-room again and took a chair close
by my own in a comfortable corner. But
now he was not alone; he came in company
with a younger man, a middle-aged, sharp-eyed
individual whom I also set down as
having some connection with the law.</p>

<p>These two men had evidently just dined;
a waiter brought them coffee and liqueurs; the
elder man produced a cigar-case and offered
it to his companion. They began to talk;
sometimes quite audibly, at others, sinking
their voices to whisperings. But they had
scarcely lighted their cigars before a word or
two from the white-whiskered man made me
prick my ears.</p>

<p>“Without doubt!” he said. “Without any
doubt, the copper box—its presence there—the
coat-of-arms—the odd legend on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
scroll—is a most valuable piece of evidence!
As soon as I heard of it——”</p>

<p>He bent nearer to his companion, and for
a minute or two I failed to catch what he was
saying. Out of my eye-corners, however, I
could see that the younger man was listening,
attentively and approvingly; from time
to time he nodded his head as if in assent.
Eventually he spoke.</p>

<p>“And you say that Pawley, in his opinion,
took him to be of about that age?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“That, of course, has to be considered.”</p>

<p>“Pawley is an observant fellow,” remarked
the elder man. “I have employed Pawley
on several occasions, and with excellent results.
I can trust Pawley’s estimate of the
age. It fits in exactly!”</p>

<p>The younger man regarded his cigar
thoughtfully for a while.</p>

<p>“Odd!” he said at last. “Very odd! But
I should say it is so!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think there’s any doubt of it,”
answered the white-whiskered person. “At
any rate, I am not going to travel all this way,
and back again, without making sure. I shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
not be deceived!” he added with strong
emphasis on the personal pronoun, accompanied
by a complacent chuckle. “Even a
point-blank denial would not satisfy me! No
dust will be thrown in my eyes!”</p>

<p>“You were fully acquainted with the circumstances
of thirty years ago?” questioned
the other. “Personally, I mean?”</p>

<p>“Fully! Thirty-five years ago, to be exact.
He—if it is so—is now fifty-six years
of age. Oh, yes, I knew everything, was
concerned in everything,” affirmed the elder
man.</p>

<p>“Up to a certain point, you know, up to a
certain point. Now, if I can only get at close
quarters, and Pawley assures me that’s by no
means difficult, I can satisfy myself rather
cleverly. For instance——”</p>

<p>Once more he leaned nearer to his companion
and lowered his voice; the conversation
tailed off into whisperings. And now,
fearful lest I should in any way betray myself,
I rose from my chair, left their neighbourhood,
and under pretence of looking at the evening
newspapers spread out on a centre table, went
across to another part of the room. I picked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
up a paper and sat down, affecting to look at
it. But in reality, I was still watching the
two men, and wondering what it was that they
were talking about.</p>

<p>For without doubt it had to do with
my host, Parslewe. The references to the
copper box, to the coat-of-arms engraved on
it, to the curiously worded motto appearing
on the scroll beneath, all that meant Parslewe.
Pawley, again; whom had Pawley been visiting
but Parslewe? And Pawley’s estimate,
so much valued by White Whiskers, that was,
of course, in relation to the age of Parslewe.
It was all Parslewe, and it didn’t require
much thought or reflection or analysis on my
part to decide that about and around Parslewe
hung a decided mystery.</p>

<p>But of what nature? It seemed to me,
judging him by my short yet very intimate
acquaintanceship, that Parslewe was a decidedly
frank and candid man. He had told
me a good deal about himself. He had left
England as a very young man, gone East,
settled down in Madras, gone into partnership
there with another Englishman, Madrasia’s
father, trading in cotton and indigo, made a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
big fortune, and, on the death of his partner
and his partner’s wife, had brought Madrasia
to England, to settle down as I had found
them. All that seemed a plain and straight
story, with nothing remarkable or mysterious
about it. What, then, were these men after?
For there was no doubt in my mind now that
Pawley had come to Kelpieshaw as a spy,
seeking some particular information, and evidently
getting what he wanted in an inspection
of Parslewe and an examination of the
copper box.</p>

<p>That copper box began to assume a sinister
significance in my thoughts of it and its relation
to this affair. But what was its relation?
It was a box, and it was made of copper.
Beautifully made, to be sure, and by some
man who had taken vast artistic pride in his
work; the engraving of the coat-of-arms, too,
was beautifully done. But, after all, it was
only a copper box! What was there about
it, then, or appertaining to it, that made these
men, if not exactly keen about it, at any rate
remarkably interested in the mere fact of its
existence?</p>

<p>I saw no more of the two men in the smoking-room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
that night, except that I caught a
glimpse of White Whiskers, as I had come
to call him, going bedward at the same time
as myself, and on my corridor. I saw him
again next morning, in the coffee-room, at
breakfast; he looked bigger, more solemn
and judicial than ever. But no Pawley came
to him; I wondered what had become of
Pawley. Perhaps he had gone back to sneak
round Kelpieshaw again—anyway, I myself
was going back there as soon as my canvas
was ready. And I had already made up my
mind that when I got there I should tell
Parslewe that at Newcastle there were people
talking about him and his copper box.</p>

<p>The man who was making my canvas had
his shop in a side street off Haymarket; I
set off to it a little before noon, intending to
get my parcel, return to the station, and
depart for Wooler. But half-way up Percy
Street I suddenly saw White Whiskers, a
little way in front of me. With him was the
man with whom I had seen him in conversation
the night before. Once more they
were in conversation; it seemed to be earnest
and intense, judging by their attitude; White<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
Whiskers had his arm linked in that of his
companion, to whom he bent, confidently;
the other listened with rapt attention. Out
of sheer curiosity I followed them. They
turned, eventually, into St. Thomas Street,
and then began to look at the names over
the shops. Finally, White Whiskers raised
his umbrella and pointed to a sign; a moment
later they entered the shop beneath it. And
from a little distance I saw what was on the
sign: <span class="smcap">Bickerdale, Whitesmith and Coppersmith</span>.</p>

<p>Copper again! copper box, coppersmith—the
whole thing was becoming more mysterious
than ever! Here were these men, who
had been talking about a copper box the
night before, now entering the shop of a man
who worked in copper. Why? I wanted to
know. And instead of going off on my own
proper business to the artist’s colourman’s
shop, I crossed the street, walked on a little,
turned, and kept an eye on the door into
which White Whiskers and his companion
had vanished.</p>

<p>They were in there about half-an-hour.
I stuck to my post, though I knew I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
running the risk of losing my train. At last
they came out. They came nodding and
wagging their heads as if whatever had
transpired within had settled the question—White
Whiskers, in particular, looked uncommonly
satisfied with himself. They went
away, round the corner into the Haymarket—and
thereupon, with a desperate resolution
generated by sheer curiosity, I boldly
entered the coppersmith’s establishment. Its
proprietor, an uncomfortably canny-looking
sort of person, elderly and spectacled, stood
behind the counter; his keen eyes fell upon
me at once with such shrewd inquiry that
I felt decidedly embarrassed, and knew
myself to be growing red about cheeks
and ears.</p>

<p>“Oh, ah, er,” I began lamely. “I—that is—have
you any old articles in copper, you
know—curiosities and that sort of thing—to
sell?”</p>

<p>It seemed to me that he took an unconscionable
time in replying. When he did reply, it
was with a curt monosyllable.</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>“The fact is I—sometimes—go in for
collecting such things,” I said. “I——”</p>

<p>He suddenly bent forward across his
counter, and gave me a keen, searching look.</p>

<p>“What are you after, young man?” he
asked severely. “I saw you—watching those
gentlemen.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">IV<br>

<i>Midnight Warning</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I&#8202; GLANCED round, involuntarily, at the
window of the man’s shop, and saw that,
there being little in it, he would certainly
have been able, while talking to White
Whiskers and his companion, to command
a view of the other side of the street, and so
had doubtless seen me hanging about. But
his curt manner helped to disperse my embarrassment
and awkwardness, and I boldly
took another line. After all, I had—as far
as I knew—as good a right to ask questions
as White Whiskers had.</p>

<p>“Well, supposing I was watching them?”
I retorted. “I may have had a good reason,
and very good reason! What do you say
to that?”</p>

<p>He began to shift about the things on his
counter, aimlessly. I remained watching
him. Suddenly he looked up, nervously, but
defiantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>“You’re not going to get anything out of
me!” he said. “I’ve said my say already,
and I’ve been warned against such as you.”
Then he assumed a sneering look and tone.
“Old copper articles!” he flung at me. “You
should think shame of yourself coming in on a
man with false excuses like that!”</p>

<p>I saw now that there was something, and I
gave him a thrust that was intended to go
right home.</p>

<p>“Copper is a good word!” said I. “And I
wonder if you’ve ever seen or handled an old
copper box, a few inches square, with a coat-of-arms
engraved on it, and an unusual motto
beneath that? Come, now!”</p>

<p>He stood straight up at that, and I knew
that he had seen such a thing, and that the
two men who had just gone had been at him
about it. And having made this discovery,
and without another word, I turned on my
heel and went swiftly out of the shop, leaving
him staring after me.</p>

<p>But if he was bewildered, so was I. What
on earth was all this mystery, plainly centring
round Parslewe and his copper box? I
had walked up the street, turned a corner, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
gone far down another street before I remembered
my canvas and my train. I turned
back, got the canvas, and made for the hotel
and the station. And of course, through poking
my nose into other people’s affairs, I had
missed the train to Alnwick and Wooler, and
there wasn’t another until late in the afternoon.
So I lunched in the hotel, and idled the
time away there—chiefly wondering about this
thing. Parslewe—Pawley—White Whiskers—the
coppersmith—and that infernal copper
box in the middle of them! What was the
mystery attached to them and it? Was it
fraud?—was it some matter of felony?—was it
murder? I was going to tell Parslewe what I
had discovered, anyway, and as quickly as possible.
But I had to cool my heels until between
five and six o’clock, and when at last I
walked out on the platform to my train I saw
White Whiskers standing at the door of a
first-class carriage talking to the man who had
gone with him to the coppersmith’s shop.
White Whiskers had his bag and his rug in
the carriage; I glimpsed them as I passed—evidently,
he was going northward by my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
train, and was, of course, on his way to Kelpieshaw.</p>

<p>I had one of the hotel porters with me, carrying
my bag and my canvas, and when he
had found me a seat I engaged his attention.</p>

<p>“There are two gentlemen standing at the
door of a first-class compartment up there,”
I said. “Do you happen to know who they
are?”</p>

<p>The man looked, and nodded.</p>

<p>“Don’t know the older gentleman, sir,” he
replied. “He stopped at the hotel last night,
but I didn’t hear his name mentioned. The
other gentleman’s Mr. Pebling, sir.”</p>

<p>“And who,” I asked, “is Mr. Pebling?”</p>

<p>“Lawyer, sir—well-known lawyer in the
town,” he answered. “Pebling, Spilsby and
Pebling, solicitors—Grey Street. Everybody
knows him.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, I departed for Kelpieshaw in
an atmosphere of Law and Mystery—I imagined
that atmosphere centring thickly
around White Whiskers in his first-class compartment
(I, as a matter of principle rather
than pence, travelled third) and mingling with
the smoke of his very excellent cigars. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
would have given a good deal to pick the
brains that lay behind his big, solemn, consequential
countenance, but I knew that I
should probably hear much on the morrow.
For that he was bound for Kelpieshaw I had
no more doubt than that our train was a slow
one.</p>

<p>It was late when we got to Wooler—so
late that I had already decided to spend the
night there and go on to Parslewe’s in the
early morning. I had some notion, too, that
White Whiskers would, of course, repair to
the principal hotel, whither I was also bound,
and that there I might find out a little more
about him—perhaps even get into conversation
with him; from what I had seen of him at
Newcastle, I judged him to be a talkative
man, and at Wooler he would have small
chance of indulging his propensities. Now if
I could only foregather with him over a smoking-room
fire——</p>

<p>But no sooner had the train come to a halt
in Wooler station than I saw that White
Whiskers was expected, and was met. He
was met, and very politely—almost reverently—received
by a tall military-looking man in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
smart, dark uniform, braided and buttoned,
who appeared to consider it an honour when
White Whiskers—as I saw plainly—extended
two fingers to him. They conversed
for a minute or two; then, talking confidentially,
as it appeared, they set off together.
And being just behind them as they left the
station, I indulged in more inquisitiveness.</p>

<p>“Who is that in the dark uniform?” I inquired
of the clerk who was collecting the
tickets at the entrance.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hilgrave,” he answered, promptly.
“Inspector of police. Nice gentleman!—not
been here so very long, though.”</p>

<p>I went on to the hotel, wondering what on
earth White Whiskers wanted with the local
police inspector. And upon getting into the
hotel, I found them together. White Whiskers
was just beginning a belated dinner in the
coffee-room; Hilgrave sat with him, refreshing
himself with a whisky-and-soda, and listening
with apparent deep interest to his talk.
I got some warmed-up dinner myself, but I
did not overhear anything that was said between
the two. The conversation seemed to
be chiefly one-sided; White Whiskers evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
explaining and detailing, and the police
inspector nodding his comprehension. But
towards the close of this episode I got some
information. White Whiskers, bringing his
dinner to an end, summoned the waiter and
gave him some audible commands. He must
be called, with hot water and tea, at seven
o’clock in the morning. Breakfast must be
ready for him at precisely eight—sharp to the
minute. And at nine o’clock the best car in
the place must be at the door to take him to
Kelpieshaw. How far away was this Kelpieshaw?—nine
or ten miles by the road? Very
good!—then nine o’clock, precisely.</p>

<p>These things settled, White Whiskers
turned to Hilgrave, bland and affable.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, now speaking in quite
audible accents, the occasion for secrecy having
evidently passed, “what do you say to a
cigar?—I suppose there’s a smoking-room
here?”</p>

<p>“Very kind of you, Sir Charles,” replied the
inspector. “Smoking-room just across the
hall.”</p>

<p>When they had gone away, I thought things
over—rapidly. It was then close upon ten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
o’clock, and I already knew sufficient of the
domestic habits of Kelpieshaw as to know that
they kept early hours there. But I felt, more
from instinct than anything, that Parslewe
ought to be put in possession of my news, and
that I ought not to leave the imparting of it
until next morning, however early. So going
out into the hall, I got hold of the boots, and,
taking him aside, made inquiries about my
chances of getting a car, late as it was. He
got one for me—with considerable delay and
difficulty—but I took good care not to let him
nor its driver know where I was going until
I had got clear of the hotel.</p>

<p>The last stage of the road to Kelpieshaw
was of such a nature that a car could do no
more than crawl over it, and it was nearly
midnight when I saw the tower of the old
house standing dark and spectral against a
moonlit sky. As I expected, there was not a
light to be seen in any of the windows, not
even in those of the upper part of the tower
wherein Parslewe had his library. I felt very
lonely when the car had driven off, leaving
me in the solitude of the wind-swept courtyard.
I knocked on the turret door several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
times without getting any response, and knowing
the thickness of the walls and doors as I
did, I began to fear that no summons of mine
would be heard, and that I should have to
camp out in one of the buildings. But my
knocking roused the dogs; they set up a great
barking, and at that a window opened, and
Tibbie Muir’s voice, wrathful enough, demanded
to know what ill body was below.</p>

<p>“Don’t be angry, Tibbie,” I called. “It’s
I, Mr. Craye. Tell your master I’m back,
and let me in.”</p>

<p>It was Parslewe himself who presently came
down. He seemed in no way surprised, and
he treated me to one of his sardonic grins.</p>

<p>“Well, young master?” he said, holding up
his lamp and giving me a careful inspection
as I stepped within. “You look a bit way-worn!”
Then, in his eccentric, jocular fashion,
and as he bolted and locked the big door
behind me, he began to spout, dramatically:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">“‘Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,</div>
<div class="verse">So dull, so dead, so woe-begone,</div>
<div class="verse">Drew Priam’s curtain in the dead of night,</div>
<div class="verse">And would have told him half his Troy was burn’d!’</div>
</div></div>

<p>“But go up, Craye, my lad, and we’ll see
if a drop of whisky’ll revive you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>He laughed again and pushed me up the
stair; I went, willingly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Parslewe!” said I. “I’m neither dull,
nor dead, nor woe-begone, but I am cold, for
the night’s bitter, and that miserable old car
I got is a trap for draughts. And as to Priam
and Troy, I’ve a tale to tell you that beats
that!”</p>

<p>“Aye?” he said. “Well, a midnight tale is
generally one that’s worth hearing. And if
you’re cold, I believe there’s a bit of fire burning,
and we’ll soon improve it. But——”</p>

<p>We were at the head of the stair by then,
and Madrasia suddenly called from her room.</p>

<p>“Jimmie!—is that him?” she demanded,
careless of grammar in her eagerness. “And
what’s he after at this time?”</p>

<p>“Aye, it’s me!” I called out, catching at her
spirit. “And I’m safe and sound, too, with a
pack of adventures——”</p>

<p>“That’ll keep till morning,” interrupted
Parslewe, pushing me into the room. “Go to
sleep again, my girl!” He shut the door on
us, drew the heavy curtain across it, and after
poking up the fire and lighting the lamp,
helped us both to whisky from the decanter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
and lighted his pipe. “Aye, and what’s the
tale, Craye?” he asked.</p>

<p>I had been considering the telling of that all
the way from Wooler—debating the best way
of putting the various episodes before him.
It seemed to me that the best fashion was one
of consecutive narrative, leaving him to draw
his own inferences and conclusions. So I began
at the beginning, which was, of course, at
the point where I first saw Pawley awaiting
the arrival of the train from the south. I
watched him carefully as I told the story, being
anxious to see how it struck him and how
things that had impressed me impressed him.
And as I went on from one stage to another
I was conscious of a curious, half-humorous,
half-cynical imperturbability about him; his
face remained mask-like, except for a sly
gleam in his expressive eyes, and he never
betrayed any sign of being surprised or startled
but once, when his lips moved a little at
the first mention of the copper box. And
twice he smiled and nodded his head slightly—the
first time was when I mentioned the coppersmith’s
shop, whereat he stirred a bit and
said softly, “Aye, that would be old Bickerdale!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
and the second when I said that the
police inspector had addressed White Whiskers
as Sir Charles. He laughed outright at
that.</p>

<p>“Aye, likely enough,” he muttered. “He’s
the sort that would turn out Sir Charles, for
sure! But I hadn’t heard of it.”</p>

<p>“That’s the lot, Mr. Parslewe,” I concluded.
“I left Sir Charles and the police
inspector smoking their cigars and drinking
their whisky. I saw them through the open
door of the smoking-room, and they were hob-nobbing
comfortably enough. And then I
raced through the night—to tell you!”</p>

<p>“Aye!” he said. “But to tell me—what?”</p>

<p>“What I have told you,” I replied.</p>

<p>He gave me a queer, questioning look.</p>

<p>“Sounds very mysterious, my lad, eh!” he
said.</p>

<p>“To me—uncommonly so!” said I.</p>

<p>He rubbed his chin thoughtfully, and then
took a pull at his glass.</p>

<p>“You’ve no doubt amused yourself with
theories about it?” he suggested.</p>

<p>“No!” I retorted. “It’s too deep for theories,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
Mr. Parslewe. Too deep for me to
theorise about, I mean.”</p>

<p>“Aye—well, we’ll say speculate, then, instead
of theorise,” he remarked, drily. “You’ve
indulged in speculations?”</p>

<p>I pointed towards the sideboard behind him.</p>

<p>“I’ve certainly been wondering what on
earth that copper box has to do with it!” said
I. “Here’s a fat, solemn, self-important old
buffer travels—possibly all the way from
London—to talk about a copper box in a Newcastle
hotel! A Newcastle shopkeeper starts
with surprise when I mention a copper box to
him! And there—with the firelight glinting
on it—there is the copper box!”</p>

<p>“Aye!” he said. “Aye, there it is—and
there it’ll remain, master!” He closed his lips
in a tight, firm fashion that I had already
come to know very well, in spite of our brief
acquaintance, and when he relaxed them again
it was to smile in his sweetest fashion. “But
that doesn’t explain anything, Craye, does
it?” he remarked.</p>

<p>“Explains nothing—to me,” I assented.</p>

<p>He got up, threw two or three small logs
of wood on the fire, and standing with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
back to it, thrust his hands in the pockets of
his dressing-gown. He puffed at his big pipe
for a while, staring across the shadowy corners
of the room, and suddenly he laughed.</p>

<p>“You can tell all that to Madrasia in the
morning,” he said. “It’ll amuse her.”</p>

<p>“Mystify her, you mean!” I said.</p>

<p>“Well, both, then—they come to the same
thing,” he answered. “Please her, too; she
thought—being a woman, and having feminine
intuition—that Master Pawley was—well,
something of what he seems to be.”</p>

<p>“Then you think Pawley came here of set
purpose—design?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Maybe!” he answered, coolly. “Didn’t
strike me at the time. I took the fellow for
being what he professed to be—though I certainly
wasn’t impressed by his antiquarian
knowledge. But then, the man described himself
as a neophyte, a novice. Well, he was—very
much so!”</p>

<p>“My opinion is that Pawley was a spy!”
said I.</p>

<p>It was a direct challenge to him to let me
into his mind. But as soon as I had thrown
it down, I saw that he was not going to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
it up. There was that about his attitude
which showed me that he was not going to say
one word in elucidation of the mystery—then,
at any rate. But just then I remembered
something.</p>

<p>“I forgot this!” said I—“It didn’t seem of
much moment at the time—but it’s this: when
Pawley was here, you left him and me together,
here, in this room, while you went upstairs
to write down some notes or memoranda
for him. During your absence he picked up
the copper box, and after some remarks on its
workmanship asked me if I knew whose coat-of-arms
that was, and some other questions
about it. He was—suspiciously interested.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean—suspiciously?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“It struck me—perhaps afterwards—that
Pawley could have answered the question himself,”
I replied. “Although he asked me, he
knew—already.”</p>

<p>“Then the gentleman knew a bit more about
heraldry than he did about sepulchral barrows!”
he remarked with a sardonic laugh.
“Well, tell that, too, to Madrasia in the morning—she
likes mysteries in fiction and here’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
one in real life. Finish your whisky, my lad,
and let’s go to bed.”</p>

<p>I knew then that it was hopeless to get any
explanation from Parslewe. I knew, too, that
he could tell me a lot, if he wanted. But after
all it was no concern of mine and I rose.</p>

<p>“I got the canvas I wanted,” I told him,
as we were leaving the room. “That’s all right.”</p>

<p>“Then you can make a start on your picture,”
he answered. “Good night, master!”</p>

<p>He grinned knowingly at me as we shook
hands at the door of my room; then he moved
off to his own. His door closed. The queer
old house became silent.</p>

<p>I slept like a top the remainder of that night—so
soundly, indeed, that it was late when I
awoke. I had to hurry over my shaving and
dressing, but after all, I was first in the parlour.
A cheery fire burned in the hearth; the
table was laid for breakfast, and on my plate
I saw an envelope; another lay before Madrasia’s.
I snatched mine up, recognised Parslewe’s
crabbed writing, and broke the seal—to
stare and wonder at what he had written on
a half-sheet of paper within.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“<span class="smcap">Dear Craye</span>,” ran his note, “you’re a good
fellow and dependable. Just take good care
of the girl until you either hear from or see
me again. What you told me early this morning
inclines me to believe that I’d better attend
to a possibly urgent affair, at once.—<i>Vale!</i>—J.
P.”</p>
</div>

<p>I had scarcely read and comprehended this
truly remarkable message when Madrasia ran
into the room. She was singing—some old
country song. It came to a dead stop as she
saw me pointing to the envelope that lay by
her plate.</p>

<i>Sir Charles Sperrigoe</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I&#8202; STOOD silently watching Madrasia as
she broke open her letter, drew out the
scrap of paper inside (Parslewe, as I had already
noticed, was an absolute miser in his
use of stationery, and made any stray fragment
serve his immediate purpose), and read
whatever was there written. The slight
pucker of astonishment between her eyebrows
deepened to a frown, and with a gesture
that was not exactly definable she tossed the
paper across to me.</p>

<p>“What on earth does that mean?” she exclaimed.
“And where is he?”</p>

<p>I glanced at this second communication;
it was comprised in one line—</p>

<p>“<i>Be a good girl and do as you’re told.</i>”</p>

<p>“Do as you’re told!” she added. “Good
heavens!—who’s to do the telling?”</p>

<p>I silently handed her my letter; she looked
more astonished than ever when she read it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“What does it all mean?” she asked. “Has—but
he evidently has gone away. In consequence
of something you told him, too! What?
But wait!”</p>

<p>She rang a small hand-bell that stood on
the corner of the breakfast table; before its
sharp tinkling had died away the old woman
came hurrying in.</p>

<p>“Tibbie!” said Madrasia. “Has Mr. Parslewe
gone away? When?”</p>

<p>“He went off at five o’clock this morning,
Miss,” replied Tibbie. “He just tapped of
me and said he’d be away a day or two, likely,
and that was all. I looked out of the window
when he’d gone, and I saw him riding off on
his pony.”</p>

<p>“Which way?” demanded Madrasia.</p>

<p>“Across the moor, Miss,” answered Tibbie.
“Roddam way.”</p>

<p>Madrasia hesitated a moment, nodded, and
turning to the table began to pour out the
coffee; the old woman withdrew. And as a
beginning of my wardership, I turned my attention
to the hot dishes.</p>

<p>“Fish or bacon?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Hang the fish—and the bacon!” retorted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
Madrasia. “Well, fish, then. What is all
this mystery? What did you tell him last
night?”</p>

<p>“This morning, rather,” said I. “Early
this morning. Well, I was to tell you. He
said you’d enjoy it. Better than any fiction!
But what it’s all about, I don’t know. I wish
I did! Perhaps you do.”</p>

<p>“I may do, when you tell me,” she answered.
“Go on!”</p>

<p>Between mouthfuls I told her the whole
story of my adventures, from the moment of
recognising Pawley to finding Parslewe’s note
on my plate. At the first mention of the copper
box she turned and gazed at that mysterious
article, reposing in its usual place on the
sideboard; when I made an end of my narrative
she stared at it again.</p>

<p>“Just so!” I said. “I wish it could speak.
But—it can’t. And what I want to know is
precisely what you want to know—what is it
all about? A first-class mystery, this, anyway!
Pawley comes, and is seen examining
the copper box. I go to Newcastle, and see
Pawley meet a fat-faced, white-whiskered old
party. I hear this person talk of the copper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
box to another man, who turns out to be a
solicitor. I have a passage-at-arms with a
coppersmith, who, I feel sure, has seen and
known the copper box—I have other passages.
I come home and tell Parslewe—and Parslewe
flees in the night, leaving me in charge of——”</p>

<p>“Thank you, but he’d far better have left
you in charge of me!” she said. “And don’t
you forget it—while he’s away, I’m boss!—never
mind what he said—and you’ve got to
be as good and obedient as they make ’em! I
countermand his order, so you’re deposed—by
me! But—I’m thinking.”</p>

<p>“What about?” I inquired meekly.</p>

<p>She pointed her fork at the sideboard.</p>

<p>“The copper box!” she answered. “What
else?”</p>

<p>I helped myself to more bacon, and ate for
a while in silent meditation.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s bewitched!” I observed at
last. “Sort of Arabian Nights’ business, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly!” she commanded. “The
more I think of it, the more I’m sure this is,
or may be, a very serious affair. Now to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
begin with, the copper box wasn’t always
where it is, nor in this house at all.”</p>

<p>“No?” I said, inquiringly.</p>

<p>She remained silent a moment or two,
evidently reflecting. Then she turned to me
with an air of confidence.</p>

<p>“As Jimmie put me under your charge,”
she said ingratiatingly, “I——”</p>

<p>“You told me just now that his orders were
countermanded, and that you were boss,”
said I.</p>

<p>“Oh, well! You know what I mean!” she
answered. “Anyway, as he said you were to
tell me all about this extraordinary adventure,
I suppose there’s no reason why I shouldn’t
be equally straightforward with you. It
seems to me that we’re at a pass where frankness
is advisable.”</p>

<p>“Absolutely necessary, I should think,”
said I.</p>

<p>“Very well,” she went on. “I remember
the copper box coming here.”</p>

<p>“You do?” I exclaimed. “Ah!”</p>

<p>“Jimmie,” she continued, “to give him the
name by which I’ve called him ever since I
was that high, is an eccentric person—very!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
Much more eccentric than you’ve any idea of.
He has fits—not in the medical or pathological
sense, but fits all the same. They take
various forms. One form is that of going off,
all of a sudden, by himself—the Lord knows
where!”</p>

<p>“As in the present instance,” I suggested.</p>

<p>“To be sure! This,” she said, “is by no
means the first time Tibbie and I have been
suddenly bereft of his presence. He departs!
and no more’s heard or seen of him until a
reappearance as unexpected as his disappearance.
And usually—indeed, I suppose always—when
he returns he brings things with
him.”</p>

<p>“The thing is obvious,” I remarked. “He’s
been hunting for curiosities.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps! But why in such secrecy?”</p>

<p>“Part of the game. The more secrecy, the
more pleasure. Human nature—antiquarian
human nature.”</p>

<p>“Well, about twelve or fifteen months ago
he was away like that,” she said. “I don’t
know where he’d been, he never tells. But
when he returned the copper box was with
him. He polished it up the night he came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
home. Of course, I admired it, equally, of
course, I asked him where he’d got it. All he
said was what he always does say, he’d just
picked it up. Off the street, no doubt, or on
the moor, or in an omnibus, or on a train!
But that’s Jimmie. And on the same occasion
he brought back some half-dozen old
books—very old, apparently rare books—about
which I noticed a certain thing, though
I never said a word to him about it—no good!”</p>

<p>“What was the certain thing?”</p>

<p>“The books are upstairs in his library; you
may have seen them. In each there’s a book-plate
with a coat-of-arms, and a legend exactly
like those on the copper box.”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen the books. I saw the coat-of-arms,
too,” said I. “Odd! And—significant.”</p>

<p>“Why significant?”</p>

<p>“Looks as if they’d all come from the same
source. And he didn’t tell you anything as
to where he got these things?”</p>

<p>“He never tells anybody anything as to
where he gets things—never! He just brings
them in and puts them down, somewhere—and
that’s all. However, the copper box disappeared
for a while—not so very long ago. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
noticed that, and he vouchsafed to tell me that
he’d taken it to be repaired by a man in Newcastle.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” I exclaimed. “Now I see some
light! That man was Bickerdale, the coppersmith.
Of course.”</p>

<p>“I’d thought of that already—thought of
it as soon as you told me of the Bickerdale
episode. But—what then?”</p>

<p>“Um! That’s a very big question,” I answered.
“What, then, indeed! But I think
somebody is very much concerned about that
copper box—why, only heaven knows. This
fatuous, white-whiskered old person, for instance.
And that reminds me—he’ll turn up
here this morning, sure as fate. What are we
to say to him?”</p>

<p>“Why say more than that the master is
away?” she asked.</p>

<p>“That won’t satisfy him,” said I. “He’s a
pertinacious old party. And he’s Sir Charles
Somebody-or-other, and he’ll resent being
treated as if he were a footman leaving cards.
Let me suggest something.”</p>

<p>“Well—what?” she asked dubiously.
“We’ve got to be careful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>“We’ll be careful enough,” said I. “Let’s
do this. If the old chap comes—and come he
will—let Tibbie bring him up here. We’ll receive
him in state; you’ll, of course, play the
part, your proper part, of chatelaine; I, of
guest. You’ll regret that Mr. Parslewe is
away from home—indefinitely—and we’ll both
be warily careful to tell the old man nothing.
But we’ll watch him. I particularly want to
see if he looks for, sees, and seems to recognise
the copper box. Pawley will have told him
where it’s kept—on that sideboard; now let’s
see if his eyes turn to it. He’ll come!—and
before long.”</p>

<p>“Good!” she agreed. “Now, suppose he
gets cross-examining us?”</p>

<p>“Fence with him—tell him nothing,” I answered.
“Our part is—Mr. Parslewe is
away.”</p>

<p>We finished breakfast; the table was
cleared; we waited, chatting. And before long
a loud knocking was heard at the door of the
turret. Tibbie Muir, already instructed, went
down to respond to it. Presently we heard
ponderous footsteps on the winding stair.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
Tibbie looked in; behind her loomed a large,
fur-collar-coated bulk.</p>

<p>“There’s a gentleman calls himself Sir
Charles—Sir Charles——” began Tibbie.</p>

<p>The bulk came forward, hat in hand.</p>

<p>“Allow me, my good woman,” it said unctuously.
It looked round in the subdued light
of the old coloured-glass windows, and seeing
a lady, bowed itself. “Sir Charles Sperrigoe!”
it announced. “Ahem! to call on Mr. Parslewe,
Mr. James Parslewe.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Parslewe is not at home,” replied
Madrasia. “He is away—on business.”</p>

<p>Sir Charles showed his disappointment.
But he glanced keenly at Madrasia and bowed
again, more politely than ever.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” he said, “I have the honour of
seeing Miss Parslewe?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Madrasia. “My name is
Durham. I am Mr. Parslewe’s ward.”</p>

<p>Sir Charles looked at me. I was purposely
keeping myself in the shadowy part of the old
room; it was darkish there, and I saw that he
did not recognise me, though he had certainly
set eyes on me at Newcastle and at Wooler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“This young gentleman,” he suggested.
“Mr. Parslewe’s son, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“No!” said Madrasia. “A visitor.”</p>

<p>Sir Charles looked sorry and discomfited.
He fidgeted a little, nervously.</p>

<p>“Will you sit down, Sir Charles?” asked
Madrasia.</p>

<p>He sat down. He took a chair between the
centre table and the sideboard. He looked at
Madrasia with interest—and, I thought, with
decided admiration.</p>

<p>“Thank you!” he said. “I—ah, deeply regret
Mr. Parslewe’s absence. I have heard of
Mr. Parslewe—as a distinguished antiquary.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Madrasia. “Distinguished?”</p>

<p>“Distinguished!” cooed Sir Charles. “Distinguished!”</p>

<p>“Odd!” remarked Madrasia. “I thought he
was only a dabbler. That’s what he considers
himself to be, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>Sir Charles waved a fat, white hand.</p>

<p>“Prophets, my dear young lady, are said
to have no honour in their own country,” he
observed with a knowing smile. “And your
truly learned man usually considers himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
to be a novice. What says one of my favourite
poets?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">“‘Knowledge is proud that he has learned so much;</div>
<div class="verse">Wisdom is humble that he knows no more.’</div>
</div></div>

<p>—Just so—precisely!”</p>

<p>“You are fond of poetry, Sir Charles?”
suggested Madrasia.</p>

<p>“Eminently so! And of antiquities,” assented
our caller. “And being in the neighbourhood,
and hearing of Mr. Parslewe, I did
myself the honour of waiting upon him in the
hope of being able to pay him my respects,
and to——”</p>

<p>“Just so!” broke in Madrasia. “So very
kind of you! I don’t think we were quite
aware that my guardian’s fame as an antiquary
had spread, but he appears to be getting
celebrated. You are the second person
who has called to see him, on the same errand,
within the last few days. The other,” she continued,
“was a gentleman named—er—Pawley.
Mr. Pawley.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Sir Charles. “Indeed!—I am
not acquainted with many antiquaries; I am
something of a recluse. And, perhaps, Mr.—ah—Crawley—oh,
Pawley?—was fortunate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
enough to find Mr. Parslewe at home and to
enjoy the benefit—just so, just so! And I—am
unfortunate.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Parslewe went away this morning,”
remarked Madrasia, in matter-of-fact tones.
“He may return to-morrow; he mayn’t. He
mayn’t return for a week; he may. He’s uncertain.
But I’ll certainly tell him you’ve
called, Sir Charles.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, thank you!” said Sir Charles.
“Much regret—and I don’t know how long I
shall remain in these parts. Delightful, romantic
situation—most romantic! You have
been here long?”</p>

<p>“Ever since we came from India,” replied
Madrasia, forgetting our compact. “Some few
years ago.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Mr. Parslewe came from India, did
he?” asked Sir Charles eagerly. “But you?—you
were surely not born under those burning
skies?”</p>

<p>“I was!” answered Madrasia, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Of English parents, of course,” suggested
Sir Charles. “Of course!—the English rose!—ah,
the English rose! No one, Miss Durham,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
could mistake you for anything else than
that!”</p>

<p>I coughed—discreetly. And Madrasia
took the hint.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry Mr. Parslewe is not at home,”
she began. “Can I give him any message?”</p>

<p>Sir Charles drew out a card case, and laid
a card on the table. Then he rose, and we
both saw his eyes turn to the copper box. He
gave it a good, straight glance.</p>

<p>“Thank you, thank you!” he answered. “My
card, and my compliments and regrets, and
perhaps I may do myself the pleasure of waiting
upon him again, if he returns soon. I
should much like to see his—ah—collections.”</p>

<p>Madrasia picked up the card.</p>

<p>“And you are staying, Sir Charles?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“For a day or two at the hotel at Wooler,”
he replied. “After that, perhaps, for a few
days in Berwick. The address at Wooler will
find me, at any rate, during my stay in these
parts; letters would be forwarded.”</p>

<p>He was still looking at the copper box, and
presently he became mendacious.</p>

<p>“What a truly beautiful old sideboard!” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
remarked, going nearer to that article of furniture.
“Mr. Parslewe is, I see, a connoisseur
in Chippendale work.”</p>

<p>He went nearer to the sideboard, but we
both saw that he was not looking at it at all;
he was staring at the coat-of-arms on the copper
box.</p>

<p>“Delightful pursuit, collecting,” he said,
straightening himself. “Well, I must run
away. Pleasure must not be put before business,
and I have a car waiting, and business at
the other end of a drive.”</p>

<p>He shook hands with Madrasia with—I
thought—unnecessary cordiality. Madrasia
turned to me.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’ll see Sir Charles safely down
the stair?” she suggested. “It’s rather dangerous
if you don’t know it.”</p>

<p>I preceded Sir Charles down the stair and
opened the door at its foot. It had been
shadowy in the room, and more so on the stair,
but there was a full glare of spring sunlight
on us as we emerged into the courtyard, and
now, seeing me clearly for the first time, the
old gentleman let out a sudden sharp exclamation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“Hallo, young man!” he said, staring at me,
while his face flushed under the surprise of
his recognition. “I’ve seen you before! Last
night, at the hotel in Wooler. And—and—somewhere
before that!”</p>

<p>“In Newcastle, no doubt,” said I. “I saw
you there two or three times.”</p>

<p>He stopped dead in the middle of the courtyard,
still staring.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he demanded. “The girl
up there said—a visitor!”</p>

<p>His bland manner and suave tone had gone
now, and he was almost hectoring in his attitude.
I looked at him wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Miss Durham described me as what I am,”
I answered. “A visitor!”</p>

<p>“Parslewe’s visitor?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Mr. Parslewe’s visitor—certainly,” said I.
“His guest.”</p>

<p>“How long have you known Parslewe?” he
inquired.</p>

<p>But his manner was getting somewhat too
much for my patience.</p>

<p>“Really!” I began. “I fail to see why——”</p>

<p>He suddenly tapped me on the chest with
a strange sort of familiarity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“Look you here, young man!” he said. “You
say you saw me in Newcastle. With anybody?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” I answered, somewhat nettled. “I
saw you with the man who called himself
Pawley.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” he exclaimed. “And you saw me
last night at Wooler, with the police inspector.
Did you come here and tell that—and the
Pawley incident—to Parslewe? Come now!”</p>

<p>“I did!” said I. “Why not?”</p>

<p>Without another word he strode off to his
car, motioned to its driver, and went away.</p>

<i>The Irrepressible Newsman</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I&#8202; WATCHED Sir Charles Sperrigoe drive
off along the moorland road, and closing
the turret door, went slowly and full of meditation
up the stair to the parlour. Madrasia
was standing where we had left her, on the
hearth; she had the copper box in her hands
and was examining it carefully. On my entrance
she put it down on the table, and we
looked at each other.</p>

<p>“Do you think he’ll come back?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what he’ll do,” I answered,
“but I think he and Pawley are pretty much
of a muchness! If he’s master and Pawley’s
man, then there’s not much to choose between
man and master! Did you notice that he
wouldn’t allow that he knew Pawley, whereas
he knew well enough that he and Pawley met
at Newcastle only day before yesterday? But
I’ll tell you what happened downstairs.”</p>

<p>I gave her a full account of the brief interchange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
of remarks between Sir Charles and
myself in the courtyard. She listened eagerly,
and her eyes lit up.</p>

<p>“Ah!” she said. “I see what he meant! He
meant that on your telling Jimmie of the doings
at Newcastle, and that Sir Charles might
be expected, Jimmie cleared out quick!”</p>

<p>“Well, didn’t he clear out?” said I.</p>

<p>She looked at me a moment in silence; then
she nodded her head, as much as to assent to an
undeniable proposition.</p>

<p>“I suppose he did!” she answered.</p>

<p>“Suppose? He did clear out!” I exclaimed.
“Before morning! Why?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t want to meet this pompous old person,”
she said. “That seems to be about it.
Yes, I think Jimmie decidedly cleared out!”</p>

<p>“Leaving us to face this sort of thing,” I
said. “If one only knew what it’s all about,
what it means, why there’s this hue-and-cry
after that box——”</p>

<p>“I think the copper box is only a small part
of it,” she interrupted. “It’s—a sort of handle,
a clue, a—something!”</p>

<p>“Decidedly a something,” I assented.
“Doubtless you observed that old White<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
Whiskers very soon spotted it. That was all
rot about the sideboard! He wasn’t looking
at the sideboard at all; his eyes were glued on
the copper box.”</p>

<p>“He’ll come back!” she exclaimed, suddenly.
“I’m sure he’ll come back! And I’m wondering
if, when he comes back, he’ll bring the
police.”</p>

<p>“The police! What on earth makes you
think that?” I asked. “Police? Come!”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you see Sir Charles Sperrigoe—whoever
he may be—in conversation with our
local police inspector last night?” she answered.
“Obvious! The old person is in consultation
with the police. Perhaps—don’t you
see?—the box has been stolen.”</p>

<p>“You don’t imply that Mr. Parslewe stole
it?” I suggested.</p>

<p>“Well, I have heard that antiquaries are not
above appropriating things!” she answered
with a laugh. “Their sense of mine and thine,
I believe, is somewhat indefinite. But we’ll
acquit Jimmie. Only, he may have bought it
from somebody who stole it.”</p>

<p>“That’s more like it,” said I. “But in that
case, why all this mystery? Why didn’t Pawley—who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
without doubt came after the box—say
what he wanted? Why didn’t Sperrigoe?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Pawley came to see if the box was
really here!” she declared. “Sperrigoe came
to ask how it got here! That’s plain, to me.
But what I want to know is, why such a fuss
about it?”</p>

<p>“And what I want to know is, what made
Parslewe vanish?” I said. “That’s much
more of a mystery.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you tell me that he seemed to know
whom you meant when you described Sperrigoe
as Sir Charles?” she asked. “Very well!
Sir Charles is somebody whom Jimmie knew
years ago. And Jimmie doesn’t want to meet
him. Jimmie, as I have told you, is a queer
man—an eccentric person. And I don’t think
he’ll come home until Sir Charles Sperrigoe
has gone away.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t think Sir Charles Sperrigoe
will go away until he’s seen Parslewe,” said I.
“So there we are!”</p>

<p>“Oh, well! does it matter very much?” she
asked. “Aren’t we going out this fine morning?
We’re doing no good here, staring at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
that wretched thing and speculating about it.
Let’s be off!”</p>

<p>But before we could make any move, Tibbie
Muir came into the room, looking very disapproving
and sour of face, and presented
Madrasia with another card. She became
voluble.</p>

<p>“I’ve told him, and I’ve better told him,
that the master’s not at home,” she declared,
“but he’ll not take my word nor go away, and
you must just deal with him yourself, Miss
Madrasia. And if there’s going to be this
coming and going at the door all day
long——”</p>

<p>Madrasia glanced at the card and passed it
over to me. It was a printed card, and the
lettering was meant to be impressive.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Augustus Weech.</span><br>

<span class="indentright2"><i>Newcastle Evening Planet.</i></span></p>

<p>“Well?” demanded Madrasia.</p>

<p>“I think I should see this gentleman,”
said I.</p>

<p>“Bring him up, Tibbie,” commanded Madrasia.
“Perhaps he’ll be the last. What can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
he want?” she went on, turning to me as Tibbie
grumblingly departed. “A reporter?”</p>

<p>“Newspaper chap of some sort, evidently,”
I said. “And wanting news! But how does
he come to know where to apply for news?
And what news?”</p>

<p>“We’re only getting more and more fog-bound,”
she remarked. “Wait till we hear
what he’s got to say; perhaps he has some news
for us. He’s here!”</p>

<p>A sharp-eyed, alert, knowing-looking young
person entered the room and made his bow.
He was smartly dressed, evidently quite at his
ease, and full of vitality. And his first proceeding
was remarkable. As he straightened himself
after doing obeisance to Madrasia his eyes
fell on the copper box, and without preface he
pointed a long, slender forefinger at it.</p>

<p>“That’s the identical article!” he exclaimed.
“Sure!”</p>

<p>Then he looked round, saw me, grinned as
if reassured by the sight of a fellow man, and
turned again to Madrasia.</p>

<p>“Mr. Parslewe’s not at home, I understand,
Miss,” he said, affably. “But you’re Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
Durham, ain’t you? I’ve heard of you. Now
if I might sit down——”</p>

<p>He had dropped into a chair at the side of
the table before Madrasia had had time to
invite him thereto; laying his hat by his side
he ran his right hand through a rather abundant
crop of fair hair—his action seemed to
signify a preliminary to business.</p>

<p>“I recognized that as soon as I walked in!”
he said, with another frank and almost child-like
smile. “Queer business, ain’t it, about
that old box?”</p>

<p>“I gather that you know something about
it,” observed Madrasia.</p>

<p>“I do, Miss, that’s why I’m here,” he answered
candidly. “Yes, I know something—so,
too, I guess, does that young gentleman. I
saw him t’other day—yesterday, to be exact—coming
out of Bickerdale’s shop.”</p>

<p>“You did?” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I did! You came out as I was crossing
over to it,” he answered. “You made old Bickerdale
jolly waxy, too, some way or other.
You see Bickerdale, he’s my father-in-law.”</p>

<p>Madrasia and I looked at each other. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
think we both had the same thought—that our
visitor looked very juvenile to be married.</p>

<p>“Oh!” I said. “Indeed?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he continued. “Been that for the
last three years—a man of a queer and dour
temper is Bickerdale. You set his back up
yesterday, Mr.—I don’t know your name?”</p>

<p>“My name is Craye,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Mr. Craye—all right. Well, Mr. Craye
and Miss Durham—or <i>vice versa</i>, if I’m to be
polite—it’s like this,” he proceeded gaily.
“There’s a mystery about that copper box,
isn’t there? I guess Mr. Parslewe knows
there is—but your old woman says he’s away—queer
old party, that old woman, isn’t she?—a
character, I should think. But if Mr.
Parslewe’s away, you ain’t! And I want to
get at something—and to get at it, I don’t
mind telling what I know. Between ourselves,
of course.”</p>

<p>Madrasia and I exchanged another glance;
then we both sat down, one on either side of
our loquacious visitor.</p>

<p>“What do you know, Mr. Weech?” I asked,
in my friendliest tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>“Yes,” said Madrasia. “It would be so
kind of you to tell us that!”</p>

<p>Mr. Weech smiled, drumming his fingers on
the crown of his hat.</p>

<p>“Well!” he said, graciously, “I’ll tell you!
Of course, I came to tell Mr. Parslewe—but
you’ll do. And no doubt you’ll be able to tell
me something. Well, me first, then. As I
said, I’m Bickerdale’s son-in-law. I married
his third daughter, Melissa—she’s all right.
Naturally, being in the relation I am to
Bickerdale, I’m a good deal in and out of
his place—go there Sundays, with the wife
and kid. Now, not so very long ago, I
was there one Sunday, and happening to go
into his workshop for a smoke—my mother-in-law
having a decided objection to tobacco
in the parlour—I set eyes on that
article—that very copper box! I was a
bit taken with the engraved coat-of-arms
and the queer motto underneath, and I asked
Bickerdale where he’d got it. He told me that
Mr. Parslewe of Kelpieshaw had brought it
to him to be repaired—it had got slightly
damaged by a fall, and needed a coppersmith’s
attention. We talked a bit about it. Bickerdale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
said it had been made—beaten copper, you
know—at least a hundred years, and was a
very pretty bit of work. It had got a bulge
in one side, and Bickerdale had to straighten
it out—very delicate and gentle business. But
he did it, and either Mr. Parslewe fetched it
away, or it was sent to him. Anyhow, there it
is!—that’s the box!”</p>

<p>Mr. Weech gave the copper box a tap with
his finger-nail as if to evoke a confirmation of
his words, and proceeded.</p>

<p>“Now, a bit—can’t say now how long exactly—after
the box had come back here, I
was up at Bickerdale’s one Sunday, and after
dinner Bickerdale took me into his office. ‘I
say!’ he says, when we were alone. ‘You remember
that copper box that I was repairing,
that you admired?—of course you do! Well,
look here, there was some goods came the other
day in an old copy of <i>The Times</i>,’ he says,
‘and my eye just happened to fall on this, on
the front page,’ and he pulled out an old
<i>Times</i> and pointed to an advertisement that
he’d marked, in the personal column. I read
it, and I gaped at it! This,” continued Mr.
Weech, suddenly producing a folded newspaper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
from an inner pocket, “this is not the identical
copy of <i>The Times</i> that Bickerdale had;
this is another copy of the same issue—I got
it, as a back number, for myself. Now, Miss
Durham and Mr. Craye, you read that! and
you’ll be getting at a very good notion of what
it is that I want to get out of Mr. Parslewe!
There, marked with red ink.”</p>

<p>He laid the newspaper on the table before
us, and we bent over it, reading with feelings
which—so far as I was concerned—rapidly
became mixed.</p>

</div>

<p>I took matters into my own hands on reading
this. First nudging Madrasia’s elbow to
give her warning that I was about to do something
requiring delicacy and diplomacy, I
turned to Mr. Weech.</p>

<p>“That’s very interesting,” said I. “And—curious!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span> 
Er—perhaps you’d like a little refreshment,
Mr. Weech, after your journey?
A whisky-and-soda, now?”</p>

<p>“Well, thank you,” he answered, readily,
with a glance at the sideboard. “It wouldn’t
come amiss, Mr. Craye; I hired a push-bicycle
at Wooler, but, my word! it wasn’t half a job
shoving the old thing over your roads—some
part of the way, at any rate! Cruel!”</p>

<p>I gave him a good stiff mixture and put a
box of biscuits at the side of his glass. Then
I got Madrasia’s attention once more, and,
holding <i>The Times</i> in my hand, turned to the
door.</p>

<p>“Just excuse Miss Durham and myself for
a few minutes, Mr. Weech,” I said. “We’ll
not keep you long.”</p>

<p>Outside the parlour, and with its door safely
shut on our visitor, I looked at Madrasia, who,
in her turn, looked inquiringly at me.</p>

<p>“Come up to the library!” I whispered.
“Those books!”</p>

<p>“Yes!” she answered. “I thought of that!”</p>

<p>We stole up the stair, for all the world as if
we were going to commit some nefarious deed,
and into the room wherein Parslewe kept his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
various and many treasures. Within five
minutes we had satisfied ourselves, and stood
looking questioningly at each other. We had
reason; the books specified in the advertisement
were all there! Every one of them!—book-plates
and all.</p>

<p>“What next?” muttered Madrasia at last.
“Of course, we mustn’t tell him!”</p>

<p>She nodded at the floor, indicating the spot
beneath which Mr. Weech was sipping his
drink and nibbling biscuits.</p>

<p>“Tell him nothing!” said I. “But, let him
tell us! Come down!”</p>

<p>We went down again; Mr. Weech looked
very comfortable.</p>

<p>“We should like to hear more of your very
interesting story, Mr. Weech,” I said. “You
got to the point where Bickerdale showed you
this advertisement. What happened after
that?”</p>

<p>“Why, this,” he answered, evidently more
ready to talk than ever. “Bickerdale and I
consulted. He was all for writing to these lawyers
at once, denouncing Mr. Parslewe as the
thief. I said, metaphorically, you know—that
he was an ass; it was much more likely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
that Mr. Parslewe had been taken in by the
real and actual thief. I advised seeing Mr.
Parslewe. But Bickerdale, he wrote, unbeknown
to me, to these lawyers, saying that he
was sure he’d had this copper box in his hands,
and that where it was, probably the books
would be. And those lawyers sent a man—a
private detective—down to investigate——”</p>

<p>“Name of Pawley, eh?” I suggested.</p>

<p>“Never heard it, but I shouldn’t wonder if
it was,” he answered. “I only heard of him.
Anyway, he came—and his principal followed
him—a big, pompous man, who was at Bickerdale’s
yesterday. And that’s where Bickerdale
and I quarrelled, see?”</p>

<p>“Not quite,” I replied. “How, and why,
did you quarrel?”</p>

<p>“Because Bickerdale, for some queer reason
or other, suddenly shut his mouth after that
fat old party had been, and wouldn’t give me
one scrap of information,” answered Mr.
Weech, with a highly injured air. “Dead silence
on his part, eh? Flat refusal! That was
after I saw you leaving him. Ab-so-lute-ly refused
to tell me one word about what was going
on! Me! his son-in-law, and more than,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
for that’s where the shoe pinches, a pressman!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” I exclaimed, seeing light at last.
“I see! You want to make what they call a
story of it?”</p>

<p>“What else?” he answered, with a knowing
wink. “What d’ye suppose I’m here for? I
don’t believe Mr. Parslewe—I’ve heard of him,
many a time—stole that blessed box—not I!
But there’s romance, and mystery, and what
not about the whole thing, and I want to work
it up and make a live column, or a couple of
’em, out of it, and so I came to the fountainhead,
and Mr. Parslewe’s away, worse luck.
Now, <i>can</i> you tell me anything?”</p>

<p>We got rid of Mr. Weech by promising him
faithfully that on Mr. Parslewe’s return we
would tell him all that had transpired, and
would entreat him to favour our visitor with
his exclusive confidence, and after another
whisky-and-soda, during his consumption of
which he told us confidentially that he meant
to Ride High, he went away, leaving us more
mystified than ever.</p>

<p>And we were still more mystified when,
during the course of that afternoon, a telegraph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
boy came all the way over the moors
from Wooler, bringing me a message. It was,
of course, from Parslewe, and, as Madrasia at
once remarked, just like him.</p>

<p><i>Both of you meet me Newcastle Central
Station noon to-morrow.</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VII<br>

<i>What the Dying Man Said</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE discussed that telegram during the
greater part of the next few hours,
arguing out its meanings and significances;
we became no wiser in the process, but it
seemed hopeless to endeavour to settle down
to anything else. Madrasia, I think, got some
relief in making the necessary arrangements
for our departure in the morning; I think, too,
that she was further relieved at the prospect
of meeting her eccentric guardian and getting—or
attempting to get—some explanation of
these curious proceedings. For that they were
curious, to the last degree, was beyond question.
My own rapid review of them, taking
in everything from the first coming of Pawley
to the visit of Mr. Augustus Weech, only
served to convince me that we were becoming
hopelessly entangled in a series of problems
and theories about which it was as useless as it
was impossible to speculate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>But there was more to come before the afternoon
closed. First of all came another wire
from Parslewe. It was short and peremptory,
like the first, but it was more illuminating, and,
in some queer way, it cheered us up.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Bring the box with you.</i></p>

<p>Madrasia clapped her hands.</p>

<p>“That’s better!” she exclaimed. “That’s
lots better! It means that he’s clearing things
up, or he’s going to. For heaven’s sake, don’t
let’s forget the copper box! Which of us is
most to be depended upon for remembering?”</p>

<p>“I, of course,” said I, “being a man.”</p>

<p>“We’ll debate that on some other occasion,”
she retorted. “As a woman—Lord! what’s
that?”</p>

<p>Old Tibbie was just entering with the tea-tray;
as she opened the door, a loud, insistent
knocking came on the iron-studded panels at
the foot of the stair. Tibbie groaned and almost
dropped her tray, and Madrasia turned
appealingly to me.</p>

<p>“We’re all getting nervous,” she said.
“Will you run down?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>I went down the stair, opened the great
door, and found myself confronting a fresh-coloured,
pleasant-faced man who had just
dismounted from a serviceable but handsome
cob and stood in the courtyard with its bridle
over his arm. He smiled at sight of me.</p>

<p>“Mr. Craye, I’m sure?” he said. “I’ve
heard of you. Staying here with Mr. Parslewe.
Now, is Mr. Parslewe in? I mean, has
he returned?”</p>

<p>“No!” I answered, bluntly enough.</p>

<p>He looked at me with a glance that was
at once understanding and confidential; there
was, I thought, something very like the suspicion
of a wink in his eye.</p>

<p>“The fact of the case is, I’m his solicitor,”
he remarked. “And——”</p>

<p>But just then Madrasia came flying down
the stairs, and greeted the visitor so warmly
that for the fraction of a second I really felt
jealous.</p>

<p>“Mr. Murthwaite!” she cried, catching his
readily extended hand and shaking it almost
fervently. “Oh!—this is awfully good of you.
We’re in an absolute muddle here—mentally,
I mean—and now you’ll clear everything up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
for us! The sight of you is as good as sunshine
after storm. Come in!—old Edie shall
take your horse. This gentleman is Mr. Alvery
Craye, a famous artist, and he’s nearly
as much out of his wits as I am!”</p>

<p>“Then I find myself in queer and possibly
dangerous company!” remarked Mr. Murthwaite,
with another half wink at me. “However,
I hope you’re sane enough to give me
some tea, Miss Durham? Good!—then I’ll
come in.” He handed his horse over to old
Muir and followed Madrasia up the stair, I
coming behind. His tone had been light and
bantering up to then, but as soon as the
three of us had reached the parlour and I had
closed the door he turned to both with a quick,
searching, earnest glance, and, unconsciously,
I think, lowered his voice. “Now look here,”
he said, in the tone of a man who wants a direct
answer. “Do you young people, either
of you, know where Parslewe is? What I
really mean, though, is—is he in this house?”</p>

<p>“In this house!” exclaimed Madrasia.
“Good heavens! Do you mean—hidden?”</p>

<p>“Why not?” answered Murthwaite. “I dare
say one who knows it could hide in this old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
place for a month. But is he? Or anywhere
about?”</p>

<p>Madrasia looked at me; I looked at the two
telegrams which were lying on the table beyond
the tea-tray.</p>

<p>“As Mr. Murthwaite is Mr. Parslewe’s
solicitor,” said I, “I should show him those
wires. They are the best answer to his question.”</p>

<p>“Yes!” agreed Madrasia. She snatched up
the telegrams, and put them in Murthwaite’s
hand; we both watched him intently while he
read. “There!” she said, as he folded them
again. “What do you think?”</p>

<p>“I think that Parslewe is a very strange
man!” replied Murthwaite. “I think, too, that
I must have a talk to you—both—about him.
Now, as the tea is there, and you are so hospitable——”</p>

<p>We gathered round the table, and Madrasia
began to busy herself with the teapot and the
cups. It was useless to attempt the talking
of nothings; we were all full of the occasion
of Murthwaite’s visit, and he was acute enough
not to keep Madrasia and myself waiting for
his news.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“I’ll tell you, briefly, what brought me
here,” he said, after his first cup. “To-day,
about noon, I had a visit from a Sir Charles
Sperrigoe, who, after introducing himself as a
fellow solicitor from a distant part of the
country, told me that he had just ascertained
in the town that I was solicitor to Mr. James
Parslewe of Kelpieshaw; that he had been out
to Kelpieshaw to find Mr. Parslewe, had failed
to find him, and so had come to me. He then
told me a very wonderful tale, which I am
quite at liberty to tell you, and will tell to
you presently. But first, I want to hear from
Mr. Craye a story which I think he can tell
about Newcastle. Sir Charles is under the
impression that Mr. Craye told something to
Mr. Parslewe last night which sent him off on
his travels. I should like to hear that story,
and then I’ll tell you what Sir Charles Sperrigoe
told me, under persuasion.”</p>

<p>“I’d better tell you the plain facts about the
whole affair, from the coming here of a man
named Pawley until your own arrival just
now,” said I. “You’ll then have the entire
history of the matter before you, as far as I
know it. It’s this——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>He listened carefully, sipping his tea and
munching his toast, while I told him everything.
Now and then Madrasia corrected or
prompted me a little; between us we gave him
all the salient facts and details, down to the
visit of Weech and the receipt of the last telegram;
Madrasia had the last word.</p>

<p>“And then you came, Mr. Murthwaite!
And if you can tell us what it all means, we’ll
bless you!” she said. “Can you?”</p>

<p>But Murthwaite shook his head, decidedly.</p>

<p>“I can’t!” he answered. “Even now it’s as
much a mystery to me as ever, though I think
I see a little gleam of light—a very, very little
one. No, I can only tell you what Sperrigoe
told me this morning. If I may have another
cup of your very excellent tea, and a cigarette
with it——”</p>

<p>He waited during a moment’s silent reflection,
then, leaning back in his chair, and using
his cigarette occasionally to point his remarks,
he began to address us pretty much as if we
constituted a jury.</p>

<p>“The firm of which Sir Charles Sperrigoe is
senior partner,” he said, “has for many years
acted as legal advisers to a very ancient family<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
in the Midlands, the Palkeneys of Palkeney
Manor, whose coat-of-arms you see on the now
famous copper box on that sideboard, complete
with its curious legend, or motto. The
Palkeneys have been there at Palkeney ever
since Tudor times—in fact, since the earliest
Tudor times. A wealthy race, I understand,
but one of those which have gradually dwindled.
And to come down to quite recent times,
a few years ago, an old gentleman who
was believed to be the very last of the Palkeneys,
Mr. Matthew Palkeney, was living
at Palkeney Manor. He was a very old man,
nearly ninety. Once, in his early days, he
had had a younger brother, John Palkeney,
but he, as a young man, had taken his portion,
a younger son’s portion, gone away from the
ancestral home, and never been heard of
again—the last that was heard of him was
from South America, sixty or seventy years
ago, when he was starting into hitherto unexplored
country, where, it was believed, he lost
his life. And so, in his old age, Matthew
Palkeney, as last of his race, was very lonely.
And one day he was stricken down in his last
illness, and for some hours Sperrigoe, the doctor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
the housekeeper, the nurse, all gathered
about his death-bed, were considerably disturbed
and puzzled by the old man’s repetition
of certain words. They were the only words
he murmured after being struck down, and he
said them over and over again before he died.
I will tell you what they were. These—<i>The
copper box—a Palkeney—a Palkeney—the
copper box!</i>”</p>

<p>He paused, with due appreciation of the
dramatic effect, and looked at us. Madrasia
gave a little shudder.</p>

<p>“Creepy!” she murmured.</p>

<p>“Very!” agreed Murthwaite. “Well, nobody
knew what the old man meant, and it
was useless to try to get him to give any explanation.
But when he was dead, the old
housekeeper, after much cudgelling of her
brains, remembered that in a certain cabinet
in a certain corner of the library there was a
small box of beaten copper which she had seen
Matthew Palkeney polish with his own hands
in past years. She and Sperrigoe went to look
for it; it was gone! Sperrigoe had the house
searched from top to bottom for it; it was not
in the house! That copper box had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
stolen—and there it is, on Parslewe’s sideboard,
here in Northumberland. That is—fact.
Fact!”</p>

<p>He paused again, and we kept silence until
it pleased him to go on.</p>

<p>“How did it get here?—or, rather, since nobody
but Parslewe knows that, we can only
deal with this—how did Sperrigoe find out
that it was here? Mr. Craye has just told
me one side of that, I can tell another. When
Sperrigoe found that the copper box had been
undoubtedly stolen, he had a thorough examination
made of the contents of the library
and checked by a printed catalogue kept
there—for the library is famous. Then he
found that several rare and valuable old books
had disappeared with the copper box. Then
he advertised. You know the rest. Parslewe
had taken the copper box to Bickerdale; Bickerdale
saw Sperrigoe’s advertisement—and so
on. And now, when Pawley, as Sperrigoe’s
advance agent, and then Sperrigoe himself,
turn up to ask a direct question as to how he
became possessed of the copper box, why does
he run off?”</p>

<p>“Happening to know him,” said Madrasia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
quickly, “I can answer that. For good and
honest reasons of his own!”</p>

<p>“As his friend and solicitor,” remarked
Murthwaite, “I say Amen to that! But—why
not have given some explanation?”</p>

<p>But it was time for me to step in there.</p>

<p>“Mr. Murthwaite!” I said. “Neither Pawley
nor Sir Charles Sperrigoe asked for any
explanation! Sperrigoe, of course, never saw
Mr. Parslewe; Pawley came here as a mere
spy——”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” he interrupted. “But what I
really mean is, why didn’t he give some explanation
to you?”</p>

<p>“To me!” I exclaimed. “Why to me?”</p>

<p>“Because you were the only person who
knew the—shall we say immediate facts of
the case?” he replied. “Evidently, although
you have only known each other a few days, he
trusts you, Mr. Craye. Why didn’t he give
you a brief explanation of this seeming mystery
instead of stealing away in the night?
Why?”</p>

<p>“As I said!” exclaimed Madrasia. “For
good reasons—of his own.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>Murthwaite drummed his fingers on the
table, regarding us intently.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see?” he said suddenly. “Don’t
you realise the suspicion he has brought on
himself? Sir Charles Sperrigoe doesn’t know
him.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that!” said I, with equal
suddenness. “Anyway, I’m quite sure he
knows Sperrigoe—or knew him once. Sure of
it from a remark he made when I was telling
him about Sperrigoe.”</p>

<p>“Eh!” exclaimed Murthwaite. “What remark?”</p>

<p>I told him. He rose suddenly from his
chair, as if an idea had struck him, and for a
minute or two paced the room, evidently thinking.
Then he came back to the table, resumed
his seat, and turned from one to the other,
pointing to the two telegrams which still lay
where he had put them down.</p>

<p>“Let us get to business,” he said. “Now I
suppose you two young people are going to
meet Parslewe at Newcastle to-morrow morning
in response to those wires?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” answered Madrasia. “And
we shall take the copper box with us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>“Very well,” he continued. “Then I want
you to do three things. First, tell Parslewe
all that I have told you as regards the Palkeney
affair. Second, tell him that on my own
responsibility, and as his friend and solicitor,
I have given Sir Charles Sperrigoe an assurance—a
pledge, in fact—that he will, as
quickly as possible, give Sir Charles a full account
of how box and books came into his possession,
so that their progress from Palkeney
Manor to Kelpieshaw may be traced—it’s inconceivable,
of course, that Mr. Parslewe came
by them in any other than an honest way.
Third, I have persuaded Sir Charles to go
home—where he awaits Mr. Parslewe’s communication.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Madrasia. “But has he gone?”</p>

<p>“He went south after seeing me—by the
next train,” replied Murthwaite.</p>

<p>“Leaving the police inspector at Wooler
under the impression that my guardian is a
possible thief, eh?” suggested Madrasia.</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort!” retorted Murthwaite.
“Come, come, my dear young lady!—things
aren’t done in that way. All that
Sperrigoe did in that quarter was to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
certain guarded inquiries as to Parslewe’s
status in the neighbourhood. The police know
nothing, of course.”</p>

<p>There was a brief silence, broken at last by
Madrasia.</p>

<p>“Of course, we will give my guardian your
message,” she said. “Every word! But, Mr.
Murthwaite, haven’t you any idea of what all
this is about? All this fuss, mystery, running
up and down country about a copper box—that
box?”</p>

<p>Murthwaite laughed, and turning to the
sideboard took the copper box from it.</p>

<p>“I’ve no more idea of the solution of the
mystery than you have,” he answered. “This
article is certainly a curiosity in itself. Fine
old beaten copper, beautifully made, and
beautifully engraved. But why all this fuss
about it—as you say—I can’t think. Still,
when a dying man mutters what old Matthew
Palkeney did, over and over again, eh? Naturally
his man-of-law wants to get at some
sort of clearing up. My own notion is that
it’s not the copper box, but what may have
been in the copper box! Not the case, but the
contents—don’t you see?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>“You think something was kept in it at
Palkeney Manor?” I suggested.</p>

<p>“Probably,” he assented. “That’s just
about what I do think.”</p>

<p>“And that the original thief has stolen
whatever it was?”</p>

<p>“Just so! The box may have passed
through several hands before it came into
Parslewe’s. Parslewe no doubt picked up this
thing in some curio shop—the books, too.”</p>

<p>“Have the people of Palkeney Manor any
idea as to how the theft occurred?” I asked.</p>

<p>“None!—according to Sperrigoe. But I
understand that Palkeney Manor is a sort of
show-place. That is, there are certain rooms
which are shown to the public, including the
library. A shilling fee is charged on certain
mornings of the week—the proceeds are given
to the local charities. And, of course, Sperrigoe
thinks that this box and the books were
stolen by some visitor only just before old Mr.
Matthew Palkeney’s death. So—there we
are! All that’s wanted now is—a few words
from Parslewe.”</p>

<p>He then said he must go, and presently we
went down the stair and out into the courtyard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
with him. Old Edie brought out the cob;
with his hand on its bridle Murthwaite turned
to Madrasia.</p>

<p>“Now just get Parslewe to come straight
back and tell me all about it so that I can
write to Sperrigoe and clear up the mystery,”
he said. “Tell him all I have said, and that
he must come at once.”</p>

<p>But Madrasia was beginning to show signs
of a certain mutinous spirit.</p>

<p>“We’ll tell him every word you’ve said, and
all about Sperrigoe coming here, and Weech
coming, too,” she answered. “But, you know,
Mr. Murthwaite, you’re completely ignoring
something, lawyer though you are!”</p>

<p>“What?” he asked, with an amused laugh.</p>

<p>“That my guardian would never have gone
away, never have wired for Mr. Craye and
myself, never asked that the copper box should
be brought to him, unless he had very good
and strong reasons,” she answered. “Do you
think he’s playing at something? Rot! The
whole thing’s much more serious than you
think!”</p>

<p>Murthwaite looked from her to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“That your opinion, too, Mr. Craye?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“It is!” said I. “My absolute opinion.”</p>

<p>He shook hands with us, and got into his
saddle. He bent down for a last word.</p>

<p>“Never been so curious about a matter in
my life!” he said. “But it must end!”</p>

<p>Then he rode off across the moor and disappeared.
And next morning Madrasia and
I journeyed to Newcastle, she carrying the
copper box, neatly tied up and sealed. Our
train ran in at the very time at which we were
to meet Parslewe. But we saw no Parslewe.
We stood staring around us until a man in the
livery of a hall-porter came along, eyeing us
closely, and stopped at my side.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, sir—Mr. Craye, sir? Just
so, sir—Mr. Parslewe’s compliments, and will
you and the young lady join him at lunch in
the hotel? This way, sir.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span></p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">VIII<br>

<i>One Minute Past Midnight</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE followed Parslewe’s messenger across
the platform to the hotel in a state
of mute obedience, being, as Madrasia remarked
afterwards, resigned by that time to
anything that Parslewe did or commanded.
But I think hunger had something to do with
our meekness; we had breakfasted early, and
had had nothing since, and as far as I was
concerned the thought of this hotel and its
excellent fare—already known to me—was by
no means unwelcome. I turned instinctively
towards the coffee-room as we entered, already
anticipating its pleasures more than my
meeting with Parslewe. But our guide steered
us away from it; he took us upstairs, along
corridors, down passages, finally opened a
door. And there was a private sitting-room,
and a table laid for lunch, and on the hearth,
warming his coat-tails at a blazing fire, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
saturnine countenance wearing a more cynical
grin than ever, Parslewe.</p>

<p>He greeted us as coolly and unconcernedly
as if we were in his own parlour at Kelpieshaw
and had just come down to breakfast;
indeed, he scarcely did more than give us
a careless good morning, his chief concern
just then seemed to be to catch the porter’s
attention before he closed the door on us.</p>

<p>“Hi, you!” he called. “Just tell that waiter
to bring up lunch, will you?—there’s a good
fellow! Well,” he went on, regarding us
speculatively as the man went off. “I suppose
you’re hungry, eh?”</p>

<p>“Very!” said I.</p>

<p>“Famishing!” declared Madrasia.</p>

<p>He inspected her critically, rubbed his chin,
and pointed to a side table.</p>

<p>“Take your things off and throw ’em on
there, my dear,” he said. “You can take ’em
to your own room afterwards.”</p>

<p>Madrasia, in the act of divesting herself,
turned on him.</p>

<p>“Room?” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Number 186, yours,” he answered, calmly.
“Yours, Craye, is 95—next mine. Don’t forget<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
the numbers—however, if you do, they’ll
tell you at the office. They’re booked in your
respective names.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that we’ve got to stay the
night here?” demanded Madrasia.</p>

<p>“Precisely,” replied Parslewe, in his most
laconic manner. “Two, maybe.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t come prepared to stay any
nights,” said Madrasia. “I haven’t brought
even a toothbrush!”</p>

<p>“Buy one!” he retorted. “Excellent shops
in the place, my dear.”</p>

<p>Madrasia stared at him harder than ever.</p>

<p>“You’re developing a very extraordinary
habit of ordering people about, Jimmie!” she
exclaimed at last. “Why all this insistence?”</p>

<p>“Needs must where the devil drives!” he
answered with a cynical laugh.</p>

<p>“Are you the devil?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly what I am, my dear,
since night before last,” he replied, with a
relapse into mildness. “But I’m hoping to
know before long. And in the meantime, let’s
be comfortable—here’s food and drink.”</p>

<p>Two waiters came in with hot dishes; we
sat down. I don’t know if Parslewe had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
expected us to be unusually hungry, but he
had certainly taken pains to order a delightful
lunch and to prove to us that he had a very
nice and critical taste in champagne. And
all the time we were lunching he kept the
waiters in the room, artfully, I thought, lest
Madrasia should open out on the subject
uppermost in our thoughts; true, he talked
freely himself, but it was all about a play that
he had seen at the Theatre Royal on the
previous evening, and of which he was
enthusiastically full.</p>

<p>“But you shall see it yourself to-night,”
he wound up. “I’ve booked two seats—Craye
shall take you.”</p>

<p>“And—you?” asked Madrasia. “Won’t it
bear seeing twice in succession?”</p>

<p>“I’ve some business,” he answered. “I
shall be out when you return; we’ll compare
notes in the morning.”</p>

<p>I saw that Madrasia was dying to ask him
what his business was, but the waiters were
still in the room. It was not until they had
served us with coffee and gone away for good
that Parslewe came to what we certainly
regarded as business. Giving me a cigar and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
lighting one himself, he turned his chair
towards the hearth, settled in an easy position
with one elbow on the table, and flung us a
glance over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Now, then!” he said. “What’s gone on
up yonder since I left? And as you can’t
both speak at once, settle between yourselves
which is going to be spokesman. But first—where
is that box?”</p>

<p>Madrasia, the morning being cold, had
come in furs; amongst them a big muff, in
the pocket of which she had carried the
copper box. She rose, extracted it from its
hiding-place, and laid it on the table at
Parslewe’s side; then she pointed a finger
at me.</p>

<p>“Let him tell,” she said. “I’ll correct him
where he’s wrong.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Craye,” commanded Parslewe.
“Detail!”</p>

<p>I told him of everything that had happened
at Kelpieshaw since his own mysterious disappearance,
watching him carefully and even
narrowly as I talked. He listened silently
and impassively; only once did he interrupt
me, and that was to ask for a more particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
description of Mr. Augustus Weech. He
seemed to reflect a good deal when he got
that, but he let me go on to the end without
further questioning, and received the message
from Murthwaite just as phlegmatically as
he had taken in everything else. In point of
absolute inscrutability and imperviousness
Parslewe in that particular mood of his could
have given points to the Sphinx.</p>

<p>“And that’s all,” I concluded. “All!”</p>

<p>“All!” repeated Madrasia. “Except that
I reiterate precisely what Murthwaite said—you’ve
got to go back to Wooler and see him
and tell him all about it and enable him to
keep his word to Sir Charles Sperrigoe. And
that’s that!”</p>

<p>Parslewe’s thin lips resolved themselves into
that straight, rigid line which I had already
come to know as well as I knew my own
reflection in a mirror. When he relaxed them
it was to indulge in one of his sardonic laughs,
which died away into a cynical chuckle and
ended in one of his angelic smiles, cast, of
course, in his ward’s direction.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s that, is it, my dear?” he said,
sweetly. “Well, then, it isn’t! I’m not going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
to traipse back to Wooler—till I please!
I’m not going to suit the convenience of either
Charlie Sperrigoe or Jackie Murthwaite—till
I please! I reckon I know my own
business as well as the next man, and I shall
just carry it out—as I please! And if you
want me to indulge in modern slang—that’s
that!”</p>

<p>“And it all means that you know a great
deal more than you’ve let out!” exclaimed
Madrasia.</p>

<p>He treated us to another of his sardonic
bursts of laughter at that.</p>

<p>“I’m not aware that I’ve let out anything
at all, my dear, so far!” he retorted.
“And I’ve no intention of doing so
until——”</p>

<p>“Until you please!” said Madrasia. “Precisely!
More mystery! Really, Jimmie, for
a respectable elderly gentleman——”</p>

<p>He laughed again, throwing up his head
as if he enjoyed being scolded, rose from his
chair, and, standing on the hearth with his
hands in his pockets, looked from one to the
other of us as if he enjoyed seeing us wonder.
Suddenly he drew one hand out, full of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
money. There was gold in those days!—plenty
of it—and Parslewe had a fist full.
He held it out to Madrasia.</p>

<p>“Go and buy a toothbrush!” he said.
“You know the town—go and do a bit of
shopping. Better get all you want—didn’t I
say we might be two nights? Go and amuse
yourself, my dear, and leave mysteries alone.
There are no mysteries—to me, anyway.”
He thrust the money into her hands, stood
smilingly by while she put on her furs, and
when she had gone, turned to me with a
laugh.</p>

<p>“Trust a woman for making the most of
a mystery, Craye!” he said. “If there isn’t
one she’ll invent one.”</p>

<p>“Is there no mystery in this matter, then?”
I asked. “It seems to me that there’s a pretty
handsome one. But evidently not to you—you’re
in the inside of things, you see,
Mr. Parslewe.”</p>

<p>“Aye, well,” he answered. “I dare say I
see the game from another angle. However,
I’m not quite so thickheaded as not to realise
that what’s pretty plain to me mayn’t be at
all plain to other folk, and I’m going to let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
you into a bit of my confidence. Come downstairs
to the smoking-room, and we’ll have
these windows opened—this room’s got a
bit stuffy.”</p>

<p>He rang the bell and gave some orders
about ventilating the room and about having
some light supper laid there for eleven o’clock
that evening (in readiness, he said in an
aside to me, for our return from the play),
and then led me down to a quiet corner of
the smoking-room. And there, having first
lighted another cigar, he proceeded to divest
the copper box of the neat wrappings in
which Madrasia had carried it from Kelpieshaw.
He set it on the little table before us,
and we both stared at it. He, in particular,
stared at it so hard that I began to think the
mere sight of the thing was hypnotising him.
Suddenly he started, and began to fumble in
his waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p>“Aye,” he muttered, more to himself than
to me. “I shouldn’t wonder if it is so!”</p>

<p>With that he pulled out of his waistcoat
pocket a tiny foot-rule, ivory, in folding sections,
and, opening the copper box, measured
its interior depth. Then he measured the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
exterior depth, and turned to me with one of
his dangerously sweet smiles.</p>

<p>“The devil!” he exclaimed. “Craye!—there’s
a false bottom to this box! I’ve been
suspecting that for the last half-hour, and by
all that is, it’s true!”</p>

<p>I was beginning to get excited, and I
stared at the box as hard as he had done.</p>

<p>“You make that out by measurement?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Precisely! There’s a difference of a
quarter of an inch between the interior and
exterior depths,” he replied. “That means
there’s the very slightest of cavities, but ample
to conceal—what?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much, I should think,” said I.</p>

<p>“No; but I’ve heard of very important and
fateful things going into small compass,” he
remarked. “Anyway, there it is! You can’t
get away from the measurements. There’s a
space—there! And there’ll be some trick of
opening the thing from the bottom—probably
connected with these feet.”</p>

<p>He pointed to the four circular knobs on
which the copper box rested, but made no
attempt to touch them; his thoughts seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
to be otherwhere. And after thinking a little,
he suddenly turned to me confidentially.</p>

<p>“I told you I’d tell you something,” he said.
“You’re a dependable chap, Craye—I showed
that by leaving the girl in your charge. She
likes you, too, and I suppose you two young
people will fall in love with each other if you
haven’t done so already, and if you have, my
lad—all right! You’ll make a big name in
your art—but never mind that; I’ll tell you a
bit about this box. Not how it came into my
possession; the time for that is not yet. But
when I did get it it was locked, and I had no
key to it, and never bothered to get one found
or made. When it got a wee bit damaged, I
took it to Bickerdale, here in this town, and
asked him to put it right. He was a bit wary
of dealing with it, but said he knew a man who
would, so I left it with him, and, incidentally,
asked him, while they were about it, to have
it unlocked. And now, Craye, now I think
that while it was in Bickerdale’s hands, or
in the other man’s hands, something was
abstracted from that box—something that I
never knew was in it. Abstracted then—unless——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>He paused, making a queer, speculating
grimace.</p>

<p>“Unless—what?” I asked.</p>

<p>He leaned nearer to my shoulder, dropping
his voice, though there was no one at all
near us.</p>

<p>“Unless it was abstracted at Kelpieshaw
yesterday, by that chap Weech!” he replied.
“Weech? Augustus? What a name!”</p>

<p>“Weech!” I exclaimed. “By him! Impossible!”</p>

<p>“And why impossible, my lad?” he asked.
“No impossibility about it! Didn’t you tell
me just now, upstairs, while you were giving
your account of all that had transpired, that
you and Madrasia went up to my library to
compare the titles of the books in <i>The Times</i>
advertisement with certain volumes on my
shelves, leaving Master Augustus Weech
alone—with the copper box in front of him?
Of course!”</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” I exclaimed. “I certainly
never thought of that!”</p>

<p>“No doubt,” he remarked coolly. “But I
did. However, now we come to another matter,
though connected with the main one. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
have business to-night which, I hope, will illuminate
me as to if anything was in the box or
has been abstracted from it since—by Weech—and
I want you to do two or three things
for me, chiefly in the way of looking after
Madrasia. We’ll dine early, to begin with.
Then you can take her to the play—here are
the tickets while I remember them. When
you come back, you’ll find a bit of supper in
that private sitting-room. Before you go, I
shall tell Madrasia that I may be very late in
coming in, so after supper she’ll go to bed.
Now comes in a job for you! I want you to
wait up, in that sitting-room, until twelve
o’clock—midnight. If I’m not in by exactly
twelve”—here he paused and produced a
sealed envelope which he placed in my hand—“put
on your overcoat, and take that round,
yourself, to the police station—it’s not far off—ask
to see a responsible person, and hand it
to him. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“Every word!” said I. “But—police? Do
you anticipate danger?”</p>

<p>“Not so much danger as difficulty, though
I won’t deny that there may be danger,” he
answered. “But do what I say. You’ll find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
an inspector on night duty—he’ll know my
name when he reads my note, because I’m a
county magistrate. If he asks you a question
or two, answer. And, if you like, go with him
if he goes himself, or with whoever he sends.
Is it all clear?—midnight?”</p>

<p>“It’s all clear,” I replied, putting the sealed
envelope in my pocket. “And I’ll carry it
out. But I hope you’re not running into personal
danger, Mr. Parslewe!”</p>

<p>His lips tightened, and he looked away, as
if to intimate that that was a matter he
wouldn’t discuss, and presently he began to
talk about something of a totally different
nature. I wanted to ask him what I should
do supposing anything did happen to him,
but I dared not; I saw well enough that he had
done with things for the time being, and that
there was nothing to be done but to carry out
his instructions.</p>

<p>We dined quietly downstairs at half-past
six; when, nearly an hour later, Madrasia and
I drove off to the theatre, we left Parslewe
calmly chatting to an old gentleman in the
lounge. He waved his cigar to us as we
passed, then called Madrasia back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>“You go to bed when you get in, child,” he
said. “At least, when you’ve had some supper.
Don’t wait for me; I mayn’t be in till the
early hours.”</p>

<p>Then he waved her off, and we went away,
Madrasia mildly excited at the thought of the
play, and I feeling uncommonly anxious and
depressed. For the possibilities of the situation
which might arise at midnight were not
pleasant to contemplate, and the more I
thought about them the less I liked them. It
was useless to deny that Parslewe was a
strange, even an eccentric man, who would do
things in his own fashion, and I was sufficiently
learned in the ways of the world,
young as I was, to know that such men run
into danger. Where was he going that night,
and to do—what? Evidently on some mission
which might need police interference. And
supposing that interference came along too
late? What was I to do then? When all was
said and done, and in spite of what he had
said about myself and Madrasia in his easy-going
fashion, I was almost a stranger to him
and to her, and I foresaw complications if
anything serious happened to him. I did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
particularly love Parslewe that evening; I
thought he might have given me more of his
confidence. But there it was! and there was
Madrasia. And Madrasia seemed to have been
restored to a more serene state of mind by
this rejoining of her guardian; evidently she
possessed a sound belief in Parslewe’s powers.</p>

<p>“Did he tell you anything this afternoon
when I was out shopping?” she inquired suddenly
as we rode up Grey Street. “I’m sure
you must have talked.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I answered. “A little. He thinks
the copper box has a false bottom, a narrow
cavity, in it, and that something has been concealed
there, and stolen from it. Possibly by
our friend Weech.”</p>

<p>“Weech!” she exclaimed. “When?”</p>

<p>“When we left him alone with the box
while we went up to the library,” I replied.
“Of course, that’s possible—if Weech knew
the secret.”</p>

<p>This seemed to fill her with new ideas.</p>

<p>“I wonder!” she said, musingly. “And is—is
that what he’s after, here, in Newcastle?”</p>

<p>“Something of the sort,” I assented. “At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
least, I gather so. You know what he is—better
than I do.”</p>

<p>She sat for a time in silence—in fact, till
the cab drew up at the theatre. Then she
spoke.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing about Jimmie,” she remarked,
reassuringly, “nobody will get the
better of him! So let him work things out.”</p>

<p>I did not tell her that there was no question
of choice on my part. We saw the play which
Parslewe had commended so highly; we went
back to the hotel; we had supper together;
then Madrasia went off to her room. And it
was then twenty minutes to twelve, and I sat
out every one of them, waiting, watching the
door, listening for a step in the corridor without.
But Parslewe did not come.</p>

<p>And at one minute past twelve I seized my
overcoat and cap and left the room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IX<br>

<i>The Whitesmith’s Parlour</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE were few people about in the big
hall of the hotel, but amongst them was
the principal hall-porter, who, as I came
there, appeared to be handing over his duties
to his deputy for the night. An idea occurred
to me, and I went up to him, drawing him
aside.</p>

<p>“You know Mr. Parslewe?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Mr. Parslewe, sir—yes, sir!” he answered.</p>

<p>“Have you seen him go out this evening?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Mr. Parslewe went out just
about eleven, sir—not many minutes before
you came in with the young lady.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t seen him come in again?”</p>

<p>“Not yet, sir—not been in since then.”</p>

<p>I nodded, and went out into the street. So
Parslewe’s business, whatever it was, had been
fixed for a late hour, after eleven. He might
have gone with us to the theatre, then!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
Unless, indeed, he had been doing other business
at the hotel. But it was no use speculating
on these things, my job was to do his
bidding. And it was not cowardice on my
part that I heartily disliked the doing of it.
I had no idea as to the whereabouts of the
police station. Parslewe had said it was close
by, but I did not know in which direction. I
might have inquired in the hotel, but I did not
wish the hotel people to know that we were or
were about to be mixed up with the police; it
might have got to Madrasia’s ears before
I got back. There were still people in the
streets, I could ask my way. And just then,
as I might have expected, a policeman came
round the corner, and at my question directed
me. Parslewe had been quite correct, the
place was close at hand.</p>

<p>I went in, wonderingly, having never been
in such a building before, and not knowing
what to expect, I had no more idea of what
a police headquarters was like than of the
interior of an Eastern palace, perhaps less.
It was all very ordinary, when I got inside;
there was a well-lighted office, with a counter,
and tables, and desks; three or four policemen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
stood or sat about, examining papers or
writing in books. One of them, seeing me
approach the counter and probably noticing
my diffident and greenhorn air, got off his
stool, put his pen behind his ear, and came
across with an almost fatherly solicitude on
his fresh-coloured face.</p>

<p>“Can I see some responsible official?” I
asked.</p>

<p>He half turned, indicating a man who wore
braid on his closely buttoned tunic, and sat
at a desk in the corner.</p>

<p>“Inspector, sir,” he said. “Speak to him.”</p>

<p>He lifted a hinged door in the counter, and
I went across to the man in question. He
looked up as I drew near, and gave me a swift
glance from top to toe. I had a vague sense
of thankfulness that I was well dressed.</p>

<p>“Yes!” he said.</p>

<p>I got close to him. Possibly I looked mysterious—anyway,
I felt so.</p>

<p>“You know Mr. James Parslewe of Kelpieshaw,
near Wooler?” I suggested.</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Parslewe is staying at the North
Eastern Station Hotel. I am staying there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
with him. He asked me, in case of a certain
eventuality——”</p>

<p>He interrupted me with an almost imperceptible
smile—amused, I think, at my
precision of language.</p>

<p>“What eventuality?”</p>

<p>“In case he was not back at his hotel by
midnight, I was to bring and give you this
note from him,” I answered, and laid the
letter on his desk. “He was not back—so I
came straight to you.”</p>

<p>He picked up and opened the letter and
began to read it; from where I stood I could
see that it covered three sides of a sheet of
the hotel notepaper. There was not a sign
of anything—surprise, perplexity, wonder—on
the man’s face as he read—and he only
read the thing over once. Then he folded
the letter, put it in his desk, and turned to
me.</p>

<p>“Mr. Alvery Craye, I think?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I.</p>

<p>“Do you know what’s in this letter, Mr.
Craye?” he went on. “Did Mr. Parslewe tell
you its contents?”</p>

<p>“No,” I replied. “But he said I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
answer any questions you asked, and, if you
go anywhere in consequence of the letter, I
could go with you.”</p>

<p>“I’ve only one question,” he remarked.
“Do you know what time Mr. Parslewe left
the hotel?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said. “I found that out. He left
just about eleven—a few minutes before, I
gathered from the hall-porter.”</p>

<p>He nodded, turned a key in his desk, put
the key in his pocket, rose, and asking me
to sit down a moment, went across the room
and through a door at its farther extremity.
Within a couple of minutes he was back
again, in company with a man in plain clothes;
he himself had put on a uniform overcoat and
peaked cap. He made some whispered communication
to a sergeant who was busily writing
at a table in the centre of the room; then
he beckoned to me, and the three of us went
out into the night.</p>

<p>At that moment I had not the slightest idea
as to our destination. There was a vague
notion, utterly cloudy, in my mind that we
might be going to some dark and unsavoury
quarter of the city; I had been in Newcastle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
two or three times previously, and in my wanderings
had realised that it harboured some
slums which were quite as disreputable as anything
you can find in Liverpool or Cardiff.
But my companions turned up town, towards
the best parts of the place. It was quiet in
those spacious and stately streets, and the
echo of our footsteps sounded eerie in the
silence. Nobody spoke until we had walked
some distance; then the inspector turned
to me.</p>

<p>“Did Mr. Parslewe speak to you of any
possible danger, Mr. Craye, as regards what
he was after?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you precisely what he did say,”
I answered. “He said, ‘Not so much danger
as difficulty, though I won’t deny that there
may be danger.’ His exact words!”</p>

<p>“Just so,” he remarked. “And he didn’t
tell you much more?”</p>

<p>“He told me nothing, except that he was
hoping to get hold of a possible something,”
I replied. “If you know Mr. Parslewe, you
know that on occasion, when it suits him, he
can be both vague and ambiguous.”</p>

<p>“I know Mr. Parslewe—well enough!” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
answered, with a sly chuckle. “Highly eccentric
gentleman, Mr. Parslewe, and uncommonly
fond of having his own way, and going
his own way, and taking his own line about
everything. There isn’t one of his brother
magistrates in all Northumberland who isn’t
aware of that, Mr. Craye! Then, you have no
idea of where we are going just now?”</p>

<p>“No idea whatever!” I answered.</p>

<p>“Well, as he said you could go with us, I
may as well tell you,” he remarked, with another
laugh. “We’re going to the house and
shop of one Bickerdale, a whitesmith and coppersmith,
in a side street just up here. That’s
where Mr. Parslewe’s gone.”</p>

<p>Of course, I might have known it! I felt
myself an ass for not having thought of it before.
But I started, involuntarily.</p>

<p>“The name seems familiar to you,” suggested
the inspector.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know it!” I asserted. “I’ve been
in that shop. Oh! so he’s there, is he?”</p>

<p>“That’s where we’re to look for him, anyway,”
he replied. “But whether we do find
him there, or, if we do, under what conditions
it’ll be, that I don’t know. However, we’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
carrying out his instructions, and here’s the
corner of the street.”</p>

<p>I knew that corner well enough, and the
street, too. It was there that I had shadowed
White Whiskers and the Newcastle solicitor,
and thence that I had retreated after my
passage-at-arms with Bickerdale. Presently
we stood before the side door of Bickerdale’s
shop, the door which presumably led to his
house at the rear. There was no light visible
through the transom over the door, none in
the shop window, none in the windows over
the shop. And when the plain-clothes man, in
response to the inspector’s order, rang the bell
and knocked in addition, no reply came.</p>

<p>It was not until we had knocked and rung
three times, each more loudly and urgently,
that we heard sounds inside the door. They
were the sounds of somebody cautiously
drawing back a bolt and turning a key. But
no light showed through keyhole or letter-box,
or the glass in the transom, and the inspector
gave his man a whispered instruction.</p>

<p>“Turn your lamp full on whoever opens the
door!” he said. “And get a foot over the
threshold.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>I held my breath as the door was opened.
It moved back; the plain-clothes man’s light
from a bull’s-eye lantern flashed on a frightened,
inquiring face looking round the edge
of the door.</p>

<p><i>Weech!</i></p>

<p>I could have laughed aloud as Weech
turned and fled, for he let out a squeal at
the sight of us, and bolted for all the world
like a frightened rabbit. And, of course, he
left the door wide open, and we were at once
on his heels, and after him down the passage.
He swept aside a curtain, flung open a door
behind it, and burst into a well-lighted parlour
or living-room with a sharp cry of
warning.</p>

<p>“Police!”</p>

<p>I got a full view of the men in that room
in one quick glance from between the two
policemen as they walked in. There was a
table in its centre, an oblong table; at our end
of it, with his back to us, sat Parslewe, calmly
smoking a cigar; at the other, morose, perplexed,
defiant, sat Bickerdale. And behind
Bickerdale, leaning against a dresser or sideboard,
stood Pawley!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>These three all looked towards us as we
entered, each with a different expression.
Bickerdale’s face became angry, almost savage;
Pawley appeared, after his first glance
of surprise, to be intensely annoyed. But
Parslewe, half turning, motioned to the
inspector and whispered a few words to him;
the inspector, his plain-clothes man, and myself
remained after that in the doorway by
which we had entered, and Parslewe gave his
attention to Bickerdale, to whose side, near
the fireplace, Weech, still nervous and upset,
had made his way round the table.</p>

<p>“Now then, Bickerdale!” he said. “Without
any more to do about it, you’ll give me
that document—you, or Weech, or both of
you! Do you hear—hand it over!”</p>

<p>“No!” exclaimed Pawley. “I object. If
there’s any handing over, Mr. Parslewe, it’ll
be to me. And as you’ve brought police here,
I’d better say at once that——”</p>

<p>Parslewe suddenly rose from his chair. He
held up his left hand—towards Pawley.
There was something in the gesture that made
Pawley break off short in his words and
remain silent. As for Parslewe’s right hand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
it went into his pocket and brought out his
cigar case. Silently he handed it to the inspector,
motioning him to help himself and to
pass it to his man. Then he turned to Pawley
again.</p>

<p>“Mr. Pawley!” he said in his most matter-of-fact
tones. “It’s very evident to me that
you and I had better have a little conversation
in strict privacy. Bickerdale!—where
have you a spare room?”</p>

<p>Bickerdale turned to Weech, growling
something that sounded more like a curse
than an intimation. But Weech opened a
door in the rear of the room, and revealed a
lighted kitchen place, and Parslewe, motioning
Pawley to follow him, went within. The
door closed on them.</p>

<p>They were in that kitchen a good half-hour.
As for those of us—five men—who were left
in the sitting-room, we kept to our respective
camps. Bickerdale and Weech, at their end
of the place, hung together, eyeing us furtively,
and occasionally whispering. Weech
in particular looked venomous, and by that
time I had come to the conclusion that he had
bluffed Madrasia and myself very cleverly on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
the occasion of his visit to Kelpieshaw. As
for the inspector and his man and myself, we
sat in a line, on three very stiff-seated,
straight-backed chairs, smoking Parslewe’s
cigars, for lack of anything better to do, and
watched and waited. Only once during that
period of suspense did any of us speak; that
was when the inspector, happening to catch
my eye, gave me a quiet whisper.</p>

<p>“Queer business, Mr. Craye!” he said.
“Odd!”</p>

<p>“Very,” said I.</p>

<p>He smiled and looked round at his man.
But the man was one of those stolid-faced
individuals who seem as if nothing could
move them; also, he appeared to be relishing
Parslewe’s cigar. With this in one corner
of his lips he sat immovable, watching the door
through which Parslewe and Pawley had vanished.
I think he never took his eyes off it;
anyway, my recollection of him is as of a man
who could sit down and watch a thing or a
person for hours and hours and hours, without
as much as flickering an eyelid—an uncanny,
uncomforting man—doubtless fitted, by some
freak of nature, to his trade of sleuth-hound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>As for me, I was wondering all round the
affair. What was Parslewe after? What was
Pawley doing there? Who was Pawley, anyway?
Why, at that juncture, when his reinforcements
had come up, did Parslewe want
to parley with Pawley? For a parley it was
that was going on in that kitchen, without a
doubt. We heard nothing; there were no
raised voices, no evidence of any angry or
wordy discussion. All we heard was an occasional
whisper from Weech, a muttered growl
from Bickerdale in response. But on the
hearth a kettle was singing, and at a corner of
the rug, near Bickerdale’s slippered feet, a cat
sat and purred and purred....</p>

<p>The door of the kitchen suddenly opened;
just as suddenly I saw that whatever had
been said, or whatever had taken place in that
kitchen, a marvellous transformation had
developed in Pawley’s manner. He held open
the door for Parslewe, and stood aside deferentially
as Parslewe passed him. When he
followed Parslewe into the parlour it was
with the air of a man who has either met his
master or been made subject to some revelation.
And it was he who spoke first—in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
answer to a nod from Parslewe. He turned
to Bickerdale.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bickerdale!” he said in suave, placatory
tones. “I think you’d better do what
Mr. Parslewe asks! I—I’ve had some conversation
with Mr. Parslewe, and—and I
think that’s what you’d better do, Mr. Bickerdale—just
so!”</p>

<p>Bickerdale turned on him with a sudden
glare which denoted nothing but sheer surprise.
I could see that the man was fairly
astonished—amazed.</p>

<p>“Why—why!” he exclaimed. “It was you—you!—that
told me just now to do nothing
of the sort!”</p>

<p>Pawley smiled in a queer, sickly, deprecating
sort of fashion.</p>

<p>“Circumstances alter cases, Mr. Bickerdale,”
he said. “I—I didn’t know then what
I know now. My advice is, now—do as Mr.
Parslewe wants.”</p>

<p>Weech sprang to his feet—an epitome of
anger and chagrin.</p>

<p>“But us!” he vociferated. “Us—me and
him! What are we going to get out of it?
Where shall we profit?” He turned almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
savagely on Bickerdale. “Don’t!” he went
on. “Don’t you do it! Never mind those fellows
over there! there’s no police business in
this that I know of, and——”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you in charge of the police in two
minutes, my lad!” said Parslewe suddenly.
“Just to show you——”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bickerdale,” said Pawley. “Take
my advice! I—I understand—from Mr.
Parslewe—you’ll not be a loser.”</p>

<p>Bickerdale gave him a searching look.
Then, suddenly, he thrust a hand into his
inner breast pocket and drew out a small
square envelope, which, with equal quickness,
he handed across the table to Parslewe. In
its passage, the light from the lamp gleamed
upon this envelope; it seemed to me that I
saw a crest on the flap.</p>

<p>“Rid of it now, anyway!” growled Bickerdale,
sullenly. “Done!”</p>

<p>We were all watching Parslewe. He drew
back to a corner of the room, where a second
lamp stood on a wall bracket. Beneath this
he turned the envelope over, examining it
back and front; I saw then that it had been
slit open by Bickerdale or Weech, or somebody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
through whose hands it had passed. And
out of it Parslewe drew what seemed to be an
ordinary sheet of notepaper. Whatever was
written on it, he had read through in a
minute. There were six pairs of eyes watching
him, but you might as well have hoped to
get news out of a stone wall as gain any information
from his face; it was more inscrutable
and impassive than I had ever seen it. He
showed nothing—and suddenly he thrust
paper and envelope into his pocket, sat down
at the table, pulled out a cheque-book and a
fountain-pen, and began to write. A moment
later, he threw a cheque across to Bickerdale;
then, without a word to him, or to Weech, or
to Pawley, he strode out, motioning us to
follow.</p>

<p>We made a little procession down town.
Parslewe and the inspector walked first; I
heard them talking about county business—the
levying of a new rate, or some triviality
of that sort. The plain-clothes man and I
brought up the rear; we talked about the
weather, and he told me that he had an allotment
garden somewhere on the outskirts and
wanted rain for what he had just planted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
Presently we all parted, and Parslewe and I
went to the hotel and up to the private sitting-room.
There was whisky and soda on the sideboard,
and he mixed a couple of glasses,
handed me one, and drank his own off at a
draught. Then, when I had finished mine, he
gave me a questioning look.</p>

<p>“Bed, my lad?” he suggested. “Just so!
Come on, then—your room’s next to mine;
we’ll go together.” We walked along the
corridor outside. “Do you want an idea—not
an original one—to go to bed with,
Craye?” he asked abruptly, as we reached our
doors. “I’ll give you one. There are some
damned queer things in this world!”</p>

<p>Then, with one of his loud, sardonic peals
of laughter, he shook my hand and shot into
his room.</p>

<i>Known at the Crown</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE various doings of that evening had
not been of a nature that conduced to
sleep, and I lay awake for a long time wondering
about them. Naturally, my speculations
chiefly ran on what I had seen in Bickerdale’s
back parlour. How came Pawley there?
What did Parslewe say to Pawley in that
kitchen that made Pawley suddenly transformed
into a state of almost servile acquiescence
in Parslewe’s further doings? What
was the document that Bickerdale handed
over to Parslewe? Had Bickerdale found it
during his repairing of the copper box, or had
Augustus Weech abstracted it when Madrasia
and I left him alone in the parlour at Kelpieshaw?
All these questions ran helter-skelter
through my brain as I lay there, anything but
sleepy, and, needless to say, I hadn’t satisfactorily
answered one of them when at last I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
dropped off to a more or less uneasy slumber.
The truth was that in spite of various developments
the whole thing, at two o’clock that
morning, was to me a bigger and more exasperating
mystery than ever.</p>

<p>And it was still there when I woke, sharply,
at six o’clock; so much so, indeed, that I felt
as if I should like to march into Parslewe’s
room next door, shake him out of his no doubt
sound sleep, and tell him that he’d got to make
a clean breast of things, there and then. As
I knew no man in the world less likely to be
forced into confession until such time as he
chose to speak, I took another course to calm
my perplexed state of mind. I rose, shaved,
dressed, and going downstairs, went out into
the big station. Railway stations, at any hour
of the day, but especially early in the morning,
have a fascination for me—the goings
and comings of the first trains, the gradually
increasing signs of waking up, the arrival of
the newspapers and opening of the bookstalls,
even the unloading and carrying away of the
milk cans, are sources of mighty attraction.
I lounged about for some time, watching and
observing; finally, as the hands of the clock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
pointed to seven, and knowing that neither
Parslewe nor Madrasia would be ready for
breakfast much before nine, I turned into the
refreshment room for a cup of coffee. And
there at the counter, a suit-case at his feet
and a rug over his arm, stood Pawley.</p>

<p>Pawley gave me a smile which was half
bland and half sickly, and wholly mysterious.
And suddenly feeling that I had as good a
right as another to indulge an entirely natural
sense of inquisitiveness, I went up to him and
bade him good morning. He responded
civilly enough, and it struck me that he was
rather glad to see me and not indisposed to
talk. He was eating bread and butter and
sipping tea; I got some coffee and biscuits,
and for a moment or two we stood side by
side, silent. But I had an idea that Pawley
wanted me to speak.</p>

<p>“Leaving?” I asked, with a glance at his
belongings.</p>

<p>“That’s it, Mr. Craye,” he replied, almost
eagerly. “By the seven-forty, sir. I’m
through with my job after last night.”</p>

<p>I noticed a difference in his tone and manner.
He was no longer the amateur antiquary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
affecting a knowledge and a jargon carefully
acquired; he talked like what he probably was,
an inquiry agent of some sort. And in consonance
with my previous feeling of intuition,
I thought that however much he might keep
back, he was not against communicating some
of his knowledge.</p>

<p>“Last night’s proceedings,” I remarked,
“were somewhat mysterious, Mr. Pawley.”</p>

<p>“Mysterious!” he exclaimed. “I believe
you! I’ve been concerned in some queer
things in my time, Mr. Craye, but in none
queerer than this! Beyond me! But no doubt
you know more than I do.”</p>

<p>“I know nothing,” I answered. “Nothing,
that is, beyond what I’ve seen. And what I’ve
seen I haven’t understood. For instance, I
didn’t understand how you came to be at Bickerdale’s
last night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s easy!” he said. “I was left here
to keep an eye on Bickerdale and to get in
touch with him. And, incidentally, to find
out, if I could, whether Bickerdale had discovered
anything in that copper box when he
had it.”</p>

<p>“Did anybody suspect that something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
might have been concealed in the copper box?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“To be sure, Mr. Craye! Sir Charles
Sperrigoe suspected—does suspect. That’s
what he sent me up here for—to take a preliminary
look round. Then—came himself.
Gone back now—but kept me here for a day
or two. To watch Bickerdale—as I said. And
last night, just as I was hoping to worm something
out of Bickerdale and his son-in-law,
that ratty little chap—Weech—in walks Mr.
Parslewe!”</p>

<p>“And did—what?” I asked.</p>

<p>He smiled, enigmatically.</p>

<p>“Mr. Parslewe, sir, is an odd gentleman!”
he answered. “You’ll know that by now, I
think, Mr. Craye, though I understand you’re
almost a stranger to him. Well—Mr. Parslewe,
he lost no time. He told Bickerdale
that he knew he’d found a document in a
secret place in that copper box—he’d the copper
box with him, and he showed us the trick
of opening it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he did, did he?” I interrupted, in
surprise. “Found it out, eh?”</p>

<p>“He knew it, anyway,” replied Pawley.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
“It’s done by unscrewing the feet—the little
knobs—that the thing stands on. And he
demanded of Bickerdale that he should hand
that document over there and then! Sharp!”</p>

<p>“And—what then?” I inquired.</p>

<p>Pawley poured out more tea, and stirred it
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“That was where I came in,” he said. “I
objected—as representing Sir Charles Sperrigoe.
I said he was the proper person to
have any document, and I was his representative.
We were disputing that, and Bickerdale
was getting more obstinate about handing
anything over to anybody till he knew what he
was getting out of it, when you and those
police chaps arrived. And the rest you know,
Mr. Craye.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” said I, “I don’t! I don’t
know anything. What happened between you
and Mr. Parslewe in that kitchen?”</p>

<p>But at that he shook his head, and I saw
that there were things he wouldn’t tell.</p>

<p>“As to that, Mr. Craye,” he answered, “Mr.
Parslewe’s closed my lips! But he’s a gentleman
of his word, and after what he said to me,
I’d no choice, sir, no choice at all, but to fall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
in with his suggestion that the document
should be handed over to him. I couldn’t do
anything else—after what he told me. But as
to what he told me—mum is the word, Mr.
Craye!—mum! At present.”</p>

<p>“Have you any idea what that document
is?” I asked, going at last straight to a principal
point.</p>

<p>“None!” he replied quickly. “But—I’ve a
very good idea!”</p>

<p>“What, then?” I put it to him. “I’d give a
good deal to know.”</p>

<p>He glanced round, as if he feared to be
overheard, though there was no one near us.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said. “Have you heard of an
old gentleman named Palkeney, Mr. Matthew
Palkeney, of Palkeney Manor, away there in
the Midlands, who died some little time ago,
leaving money and a fine place and no relatives,
and from whose library that copper box
and those books were undoubtedly stolen?”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of him—and of the rest,” I
replied.</p>

<p>“Just so,” he said. “Well, Mr. Craye,
between you and me, it’s my belief that the
document Mr. Parslewe got from Bickerdale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
last night—or, rather, early this morning—was
neither more nor less than Mr.
Matthew Palkeney’s will, which the old fellow—a
queer old stick!—had hidden in that copper
box! That’s what I think!”</p>

<p>“Is it known that he made any will?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“In the ordinary way, no,” he answered.
“But things come out. This would have come
out before, but for the slowness of country
folk to tell anything. Sperrigoes, as the old
gentleman’s solicitors, have never been able to
find any will, or trace of any. But recently—quite
recently—they’ve come across this—a
couple of men on the estate, one a woodman,
the other a gamekeeper, have come forward to
say that some time ago they set their names
to a paper which they saw their old master
sign his name to. What’s that but a will, Mr.
Craye? Come!”</p>

<p>“It sounds like it,” I agreed. “And you
think that it was that that Mr. Parslewe recovered
last night?”</p>

<p>“I do,” he answered. “For I’ve heard—Sir
Charles told me himself—that when the
old man was struck down and lay dying, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
he spoke of—as far as they could make out—was
the copper box, coupled with the family
name. Mr. Craye, I think he hid that will in
the copper box, and that Mr. Parslewe now
has it in his pocket!”</p>

<p>It seemed a probable suggestion, and I
nodded my assent.</p>

<p>“I suppose we shall hear,” I said.</p>

<p>Pawley picked up his suit-case.</p>

<p>“I must go to my train,” he said. “Hear?
Yes—and see, too, Mr. Craye! I think you’ll
hear and see some queer things within this
next day or two, if you’re remaining in Mr.
Parslewe’s company. But, I’ll say this—Mr.
Parslewe, though unmistakably a queer, a very
queer, eccentric gentleman, is a straight ’un,
and whatever he got from Bickerdale, it’s safe
with him. Otherwise I shouldn’t be going
south. And, as I say, if you’re stopping with
Mr. Parslewe, I think you’ll have some entertainment.
Better than a tale, I call it!”</p>

<p>He said good morning at that, and went
off to his train, and after buying a morning
newspaper, I turned into the hotel and went
up to the private sitting-room. And then,
presently, came Madrasia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>I was not going to say anything to
Madrasia—I mean, as regarded the events of
the night. Fortunately, she asked no questions—about
the past, at any rate; her sole
concern seemed to be about the immediate
future. There was a waiter in the room, laying
the table for breakfast, when she came in;
she and I withdrew into the embrasure of the
window, looking out on streets that had
now grown busy.</p>

<p>“Have you seen him this morning?” she
asked significantly. “No? Did you see him
last night?”</p>

<p>“For a few minutes,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Did he say what we’re going to do to-day?”
she inquired.</p>

<p>“Not a word!” said I. “Said nothing!”</p>

<p>“Not even whether we’re going home or not—or
anything?” she demanded. “No? But
what are we here for?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” I replied. “Ask him!”</p>

<p>“Might as well ask the man on that monument!”
she retorted, pointing out of the window.
“I feel like a marionette!—with Jimmie
pulling the strings just as he pleases.”</p>

<p>“Do you mind?” I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>“Well, it does seem as if one hadn’t a mind
or a will of one’s own,” she said. “Look here!—if
he comes to breakfast with some new
scheme, or plan, or mad notion, what are you
going to do—yourself?”</p>

<p>I gave her a purposely steady look.</p>

<p>“Fall in with it,” I answered.</p>

<p>“You are!” she exclaimed. “Why?”</p>

<p>“Nothing else to do,” I replied.</p>

<p>She regarded me steadily for a while.</p>

<p>“I hope he hasn’t hypnotised us,” she said.
“Seems to me he’s only got to lift a finger
and we walk after him like lambs!”</p>

<p>“Rather amusing, though, after all,” I
observed. “Adds variety to life. He may
have something quite exciting in store for us
to-day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” she said. “If you like to be led
about like a performing bear—however, here
he is!”</p>

<p>Parslewe and breakfast came together. He
had evidently been down to the bookstall to
buy a financial paper, and he sat, grim and
fixed of expression, as he ate and drank, and
read figures and statistics. It was not until
he had made an end of his food that he betrayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
any particular consciousness of our
presence. Then, laying down his paper, he
bent across the table to his ward, favouring
her with one of his charming smiles.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear,” he said, “did you buy all
that you wanted yesterday afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Madrasia, promptly, “I
did.”</p>

<p>“Enough to last you till you get home?” he
continued.</p>

<p>“Quite!” said Madrasia.</p>

<p>“You didn’t happen to buy a bag, or a case,
or something to carry your impedimenta in?”
he asked with a grin.</p>

<p>“Yes, I did,” retorted Madrasia. “Do you
think I was going to carry a brown paper
parcel back to Wooler? I bought a very nice
bag.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” he said sweetly. “All right! Then
you can just go and pack it, my girl, and be
ready in three quarters of an hour, for we’re
going.”</p>

<p>“Going where?” demanded Madrasia.
“Home?”</p>

<p>“Not just yet,” he said. “We’re going
south—by the express. A good way, too, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
we must get seats in the luncheon car. So you
be ready.”</p>

<p>Madrasia pointed a slim finger at me.</p>

<p>“You’ve never asked him!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” replied Parslewe, calmly.
“He’s going too. We’re all going. You go
and pack your duds.” He turned to me as she
went out of the room and his smile was sweeter
than ever. “You may as well see it through,
Craye,” he said. “I think we’ll have about
settled things up by noon to-morrow. And
I’ll show you something that’ll appeal to your
artistic eye. Eh?”</p>

<p>“In for a penny, in for a pound, Mr. Parslewe,”
I replied. “I’m game!—but hanged if
I know what it’s all about!”</p>

<p>“I’m not so certain that I know that myself,
my lad!” he answered. “But I think we’re
getting near it. Well, be ready!”</p>

<p>He went off then, and I saw him no more
until we all met to walk across to the express.
There was considerable satisfaction in travelling
with Parslewe, for he reduced the whole
thing to the perfection of comfort. He had
already booked three places and a table in
the first-class dining-car, armed himself with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
a heap of magazines and newspapers, and, as
he said, we had nothing to do but drop on our
padded seats, put our toes under the table,
and go away in luxurious idleness. We went—but
when that train moved out of Newcastle
and started on its long journey southward,
neither Madrasia nor myself had the
faintest idea as to where we were going. I
think it was much to our credit—especially to
hers—that we made no inquiry, and allowed
Parslewe to do just as he liked with us. Certainly
I had some vague, shadowy idea as to
our destination; probably it was Palkeney
Manor, or to some place where somebody—Sperrigoe,
perhaps—lived who had some connection
with it. But then—I did not know
where Palkeney Manor was; Pawley, to be
sure, had referred to it as being in the Midlands,
but the Midlands are wide-stretching.</p>

<p>Anyway, we remained in that express until,
after we had had lunch, it ran into Peterborough.
There Parslewe, without notice,
bundled us out. He treated us to one of his
sardonic grins when he had shepherded us on
to the platform.</p>

<p>“This is where we begin to travel,” he remarked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
drily. “That was a preliminary—no
bother about that—all straight running. But
now——”</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly, and left us; presently
we saw him in close conversation with
an official. Madrasia turned to me.</p>

<p>“Of course, you haven’t the least idea
where we’re going,” she suggested.</p>

<p>“If you mean, do I know exactly and precisely,
no!” I answered. “If you mean, do
I know to within fifty or a hundred miles,
yes!”</p>

<p>“Well?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“I think we’re going into one of the Midland
counties,” I said, resignedly. “There
are several of them. I remember sufficient
geography to repeat their names if you want
to hear them.”</p>

<p>“I don’t!” she answered. “But I wish we
were there, wherever it is. Where are we
now? I mean, in relation to where we’re
going?”</p>

<p>“A long way off,” I replied, consolingly.
“That’s what he means when he says we’re
about to travel. The fact is, we’ve so far been
on a straight line; now, I suppose, we’ve got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
to cut across country. We’re in the east,
and we’ve got to go west.”</p>

<p>There was a clock over our heads, and
Madrasia looked at it. We were half-way
through the afternoon.</p>

<p>“I suppose we shall land somewhere about
midnight,” she said. “But it’s just what I
expected.”</p>

<p>She was wrong. We travelled a long way,
to be sure, after leaving Peterborough, and
I knew, by passing such places as Rugby and
Warwick, that we were making into the heart
of mid-England. But at eight o’clock, and at
a small station, Parslewe had us out of our
carriage and into a cab; within a few minutes
we were in the quaint old streets of what
looked like a mediæval town. And even then
we did not know its name; all we knew was
that he had ordered our driver to carry us to
the Crown. Presently we were there, and
saw an old-world hostelry, out of which came
a very modern hall-porter, who, at sight of
Parslewe, smiled widely and touched his
forehead.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you again, sir!” said this functionary.
“Rooms, sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>Parslewe looked at the man with a quizzical,
inquiring glance.</p>

<p>“So you remember me, do you?” he asked.
“Eh?”</p>

<p>“Never forget a face, sir,” replied the hall-porter.
“This way, sir!”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XI<br>

<i>Back to Elizabeth</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE found ourselves in a wonderful old
house, a place of nooks and corners,
old oak, old everything; it would not have
surprised me if, as I made my way along its
queer passages and stairways, I had met men
in ruffs and women in farthingales. But it
was modern enough in its present administration,
and they served us with a capital
dinner, late as it was in the evening. That
and the charm of our surroundings put
Madrasia and myself into a better humour
than we had been in during the last tiresome
stages of our long journey. I think that by
that time we were both inclined to enter into
the spirit of the thing; it was, after all, an
adventure that had possibilities. And in the
middle of dinner Madrasia, with a whimsical
laugh and a roguish sparkle in her eyes, bent
towards Parslewe, who, as usual, was unconcerned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
phlegmatic, and apparently quite at
home.</p>

<p>“If it’s not stripping away too many of the
wrappings of your precious mystery, Jimmie,”
she said, “may one ask a question?”</p>

<p>“Aye, why not?” he answered. “As long
as it’s sensible.”</p>

<p>“Sensible enough,” she retorted. “Where
are we?”</p>

<p>“Just so!” said I. “The same question
has suggested itself to me, limited as my
intelligence is. For I don’t know!”</p>

<p>Parslewe regarded us with calm eyes and
manner.</p>

<p>“We’re in the ancient and eminently picturesque
and very comfortable Crown Hotel
at Medminster,” he answered. “Which stands
in the Market Place, and commands a
remarkable view of one of the last bits of
mediæval England, as you can read in the
guide books, and, better still, see for yourselves
in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Medminster,” exclaimed Madrasia. “But
that’s where old Sperrigoe comes from! At
least, that was the address given in <i>The Times</i>
advertisement that Weech showed us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“Precisely!” agreed Parslewe, drily. “It
was here in this very room, at that table, that
I had the honour of meeting Sperrigoe.”</p>

<p>“When?” demanded Madrasia.</p>

<p>“Oh! Some time ago,” he answered, indifferently.</p>

<p>“Then, if you’d been at home when he
called at Kelpieshaw the other morning, he’d
have known you?” said Madrasia, giving me
a kick under the table. “Of course he would,
as you’d met before.”</p>

<p>“He might have known my face,” answered
Parslewe. “But he wouldn’t have known
my name; at least, I mean, he never knew
my name when I met him here. We chanced
to meet here, as strangers, happening to dine
together at the same table; we smoked a
cigar together afterwards, and chatted about
the old town. I heard his name, but he never
heard mine; to him I was a mere bird-of-passage.
I guess,” he went on, with one of
his cynical laughs, “old Sperrigoe would have
been vastly astonished if he’d found me in
at Kelpieshaw and had recognised in me the
stranger of the Crown!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>“Have you come here to see old Sperrigoe?”
demanded Madrasia.</p>

<p>Parslewe was the best hand I ever came
across at the fine art of disregarding a direct
question. His face became utterly blank
and his lips set, and remained so until a new
whim came over him, and he began to tell
us something of the history of the old house
to which he had brought us. Of that he
would talk, but we both saw that it was no
use questioning him on any other subject,
and we left him alone. But I had already
learned something—Parslewe had been there
before; he had met White Whiskers there;
White Whiskers would know him: without a
doubt he had come there to meet White
Whiskers. But why on earth did he elude
White Whiskers at Kelpieshaw?</p>

<p>Before the evening closed I learned something
else. Madrasia retired early; Parslewe
began writing a letter in the smoking-room;
left to myself, I strolled out to the front door
of the hotel to take a look at my surroundings.
The old Market Place was flooded in
bright moonlight, and I saw at once that
Parslewe had been right when he spoke of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
it as a bit of mediæval England. On all
sides of me were ancient half-timbered houses
with high gables and quaintly ornamented
fronts; above them, at one end of the square,
rose the tall square tower of a church; fronting
it, at the other end, was what I took to
be an old Moot Hall. But for the gas-lamps
which twinkled here and there, and for
the signs and names above the shops, I
should have thought myself thrown back to
Tudor times.</p>

<p>The hall-porter came out as I stood there,
looked up at the sky, and remarked that we
should have a fine day to-morrow, and that
good weather was desirable, for people were
beginning to go about.</p>

<p>“You get tourists here, I suppose?” said I.</p>

<p>“No end of ’em, sir,” he answered. “Deal
of Americans come here—they like that sort
of thing”—waving his hand towards the old
houses opposite. “Nothing of that sort in
their country, I understand, sir. Oh, yes, full
of tourists all the summer months, sir.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t remember all their faces,
do you?” I suggested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>He laughed at my reference to his remark
on our arrival.</p>

<p>“Why, no, sir, not chance comers like that,”
he admitted. “Though I wouldn’t be too
sure on that point—one gets into a habit of
noticing, you know, sir. But in the case of
anybody who stops here a day or two—never
forget, sir. I knew your friend at once—noticeable
gentleman, of course.”</p>

<p>“Easily recognised,” I suggested.</p>

<p>“Just so, sir. Though it’ll be—let me see—yes,
three years or so since he was here,”
he answered. “Oh, I remember him well
enough. Stopped here two or three nights,
one autumn. A collector of curiosities, I
think, sir. I remember I bought him a couple
of packing-cases to carry away odds and ends
that he’d bought in the town. Considerable
trade done in that way here, sir—half those
shops you see on the other side are curio
shops.”</p>

<p>“How do they keep up their stock?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Ah! that’s a question that a lot of people
have put to me, sir,” he replied. “You’d
almost think they manufacture things! But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
the fact is, sir, this is an old part of England,
with a lot of old houses about, old country
seats, and the like. And families die out,
and the stuff they’ve been accumulating for
generations comes to auction, and a lot of it
gets into these curio shops—that’s how it’s
done, sir. Plenty of antiques in those shops,
sir, but nothing to what there is in the old
houses in the neighbourhood.”</p>

<p>“Do you know a house near here called
Palkeney Manor?” I asked, thinking that as
this was an intelligent and communicative
man I might as well improve my own
knowledge. “There is such a place, I think?”</p>

<p>“Palkeney Manor, sir!” he answered
readily. “To be sure, sir! Three miles
out—fine old house that is—sort of show-place;
you can look round it by paying a
shilling—all our American customers go
there, and the shillings go to the local charities.
Oh, yes! that was old Mr. Matthew
Palkeney’s. Dead now, he is, and they do
say that the lawyers don’t know who the
property belongs to—haven’t found out yet,
anyway. Fine property it is, too. Queer old
gentleman, old Mr. Palkeney!—and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
reminds me that I think your friend knew
him, sir. Leastways, the last day your friend
was here I remember that old Mr. Palkeney
drove up in his carriage and gave me a parcel
for him—I helped him to pack that parcel in
one of the cases I’d bought for him.”</p>

<p>“You’ve an excellent memory,” I remarked.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, one thinks of things, sir,” he
answered. “Faces, now, sir, they stir your
memory up, don’t you think? And I’ve seen
some remarkable faces in my time—faces that
you’d remember twenty years after. Some
faces, of course, is that ordinary that you
never notice ’em. But others——”</p>

<p>At that moment Parslewe put his face
through the swing door behind us, and seeing
the hall-porter on the steps came out. He
had a letter in his hand. Coming to the hall-porter
he waved the letter towards the west
end of the Market Place.</p>

<p>“Isn’t Sir Charles Sperrigoe’s office just
round that corner?” he asked. “Aye? Well,
just go and put this note into his letter-box,
will you? Then he’ll get it first thing
in the morning. Go now, there’s a good
fellow!” He turned to me when the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
had gone on his errand. “Well, master!”
he asked, in his half-cynical, half-humorous
fashion. “How does this appeal to your
artistic sense?”</p>

<p>“A fine setting for a mystery, Mr.
Parslewe,” I answered.</p>

<p>“I dare say you’re right,” he said with a
laugh. “But I think we shall have done
with mysteries to-morrow, my lad. And what
mystery there is has been none of my
making! Well, I’m off to my bed. Good
night.”</p>

<p>With that, and a pleasant nod, he went
unconcernedly off, and presently I followed
his example, more mystified than ever by his
last remark. For if he had not made all this
mystery, who had?</p>

<p>Whether the mystery was going to be done
with next day or not, its atmosphere was still
thick upon us next morning. At ten o’clock,
Parslewe, who invariably made all his arrangements
without consulting anybody who was
affected by them, marshalled us into a
carriage and pair at the door of the Crown
and gave some instructions, aside, to the
coachman. We drove off into a singularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
picturesque and well-wooded country.
Madrasia, fresh from the almost treeless
slopes of the Cheviots, was immediately in
raptures with it. Already the trees were in
leaf, the wide-spreading meadows were covered
with fresh green, and in the vistas of
woodland through which we passed daffodils
and wood anemones made splashes of colour
against the bursting verdure. New to her,
too, were the quaint thatched cottages, many
of them half-timbered, and all ancient, by the
roadside.</p>

<p>“It’s like the old England that one sees in
pictures!” she exclaimed. “It’s as if we’d
gone back!”</p>

<p>“We have gone back,” said Parslewe, with
one of his queer, grim looks. “Back to
Elizabeth! There’s not much that’s altered
hereabouts since Shakespeare’s time—neither
houses nor men. And if you’re going to
develop a taste for mediævalism, my dear,
you’ll soon be satisfied—we’re presently going
to set foot in a house that’s as old as they
make ’em.”</p>

<p>But before this came about the carriage
stopped at a wayside cottage, and Parslewe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
without a word to us, got out, knocked at the
door, and went in. He remained inside for
several minutes; when he emerged again it
was in the company of a tall, weather-beaten
old man whom, because of his velveteen coat
and general appearance, I took to be a gamekeeper.
Motioning to the coachman to follow
him up the road, Parslewe walked on
ahead with his companion, and presently
turned into a wayside wood. Coming abreast
of the bridle-gate by which they had entered,
we saw them in conversation with a third
man, also elderly, who was felling trees;
for some minutes the three stood talking
together.</p>

<p>“What is he after now?” asked Madrasia.</p>

<p>I shook my head—nothing was going to
draw me into speculations about Parslewe’s
proceedings.</p>

<p>“The best thing at the present juncture,”
said I, as oracularly as possible, “is just to
let things occur. I don’t know what he’s
after! Let him pursue it! We shall find
things out as we go on.”</p>

<p>“Where are we going?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I imagine—but I may be wrong—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
we’re on our way to that Palkeney Manor of
which Murthwaite told us,” said I. “I think
we’ve been on our way to it ever since we left
Newcastle yesterday morning. That’s probably
the house that’s as old as they make
’em. You’d better be prepared—for anything.
I am!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” she demanded.
“You’re getting cryptic too!”</p>

<p>“I think my brains are addled!” I
answered. “Never mind! I know something!”</p>

<p>“What?” she asked.</p>

<p>I bent forward to her, endeavouring to look
as mysterious as I possibly could, and spoke
in a hushed voice.</p>

<p>“This!” I said, thrillingly. “Parslewe has
the copper box in his pocket!”</p>

<p>She drew back, staring at me as if she
wondered whether my mind had given way.
I nodded solemnly.</p>

<p>“Fact!” said I. “I saw him put it there!
It’s in the right-hand outer pocket of his coat.
And in the copper box lies the explanation of—everything!
Hush!—not a word! He’s
coming back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>Parslewe came back, leaving the two old
men talking together, and I noticed that they
stared after his retreating figure with vast
interest. But instead of getting into the carriage
again, he motioned to us, in his usual
imperious fashion, to get out. Then he
turned to the coachman.</p>

<p>“Isn’t there an inn along the road there,
near the village?” he asked. “Just so; then
you go and put up your horses at it, and
wait there till I send for you. We’ll do the
rest on foot,” he went on, turning to us.
“There’s a path through the woods a little
farther on.”</p>

<p>He led us up the road for another hundred
yards, then turned into a bridle-track that
wound through a mass of venerable old trees
for a good half-mile. We made slow progress,
for Madrasia insisted on gathering a
bunch of primroses. She was putting the
last finishing touches to this when Parslewe,
who had got a little ahead, called to us.</p>

<p>“Now then, here you are!” he said. “Here’s
the place!”</p>

<p>We went on, and found him at the edge of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
the wood, leaning over a gate. He pointed
before him with his stick.</p>

<p>“Palkeney Manor,” he remarked, drily.</p>

<p>Madrasia let out a sudden, whole-souled
exclamation of delighted wonder. I was not
surprised; the scene before us was one of that
peculiar charm and quiet beauty which no
other country than our own can show. We
were looking on an undulating park, vividly
green, studded with old trees beneath which
antlered deer were browsing; there was a
tree-shaded stretch of water in one of the
miniature valleys, and cattle standing knee-deep
in it, and above this, on a rising ground,
backed by tall elms and giant chestnuts, stood
a beautiful old house, mellowed by centuries
of age.</p>

<p>We were all intent for a time, staring.
Then Madrasia spoke, softly.</p>

<p>“What a picture of a place!” she said.
“Jimmie! even you must think it is!”</p>

<p>But Parslewe gave us one of his queer
looks.</p>

<p>“Um!” he answered. “To tell you the
truth, my girl, I was wondering if the drains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
are all right! Picturesqueness is all very
well—but, however, we’ll go a bit nearer.”</p>

<p>We went slowly across the park, admiring
its sylvan beauties, past the shining water,
past the shy deer, and up to the front of the
house, Madrasia’s ecstasies of admiration
increasing with every step we took. And as
for myself, I was beginning to have a great
wonder and an itching curiosity—especially
the itching curiosity. What were we doing
here?</p>

<p>But Parslewe seemed to know. He led
us straight to the front door, which stood
open.</p>

<p>“This is a show-place on certain days in
the week,” he said. “This is one of those
days, so we can go in.”</p>

<p>We went in. An elderly woman appeared.
She wore a black silk apron, and a thin gold
chain round her neck; I took these to be
symbolic of her rank and estate as housekeeper.
And I noticed that after a first
glance at him, she gave Parslewe a steady,
knowing inspection.</p>

<p>“Good morning to you, ma’am,” said
Parslewe, with his best old-fashioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
politeness. “I understand we may look
round?”</p>

<p>The housekeeper explained. The state
rooms, including those once used by Queen
Elizabeth, and the bed in which her Majesty
had slept, were open to inspection. Visitors
paid a shilling each; the shillings were given
to the local charities. So Parslewe paid three
shillings, and we all inscribed our names in
a book—Parslewe last. And as he laid down
the pen under the housekeeper’s eye, he
turned and looked at her.</p>

<p>“Now, ma’am!” he said. “Have you ever
seen me before?”</p>

<p>The woman gave him a quiet, watchful
look.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” she answered readily. “I remember
you. You’re the gentleman who dined
here with my late master some three years
ago, and spent the evening with him. But I
never heard your name, sir.”</p>

<p>Parslewe nodded, and remarking that there
was no need to show us round, he’d prefer
to be left to himself, led us into the
hall and up a great staircase to the state
apartments. It was evident at once that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
knew the whole place, and for the next hour
he was in his element as guide while we were
lost in wonder and admiration at the things
he showed us. And we were examining the
very bed on which Queen Elizabeth had
stretched her limbs when the housekeeper
came in, more interested in Parslewe than
ever.</p>

<p>“Sir,” she said, with something of deference.
“Sir Charles Sperrigoe’s compliments,
and he awaits your pleasure in the morning-room.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XII<br>

<i>The Palkeney Motto</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was characteristic of Parslewe that he
deliberately finished what he was telling
us about Queen Elizabeth and her visit to
Palkeney before he made any move in the
direction of Sir Charles Sperrigoe. I am
afraid we only heard a half of what he said;
we were both conscious that what we might
hear downstairs was certain to prove of far
greater interest than anything Parslewe could
tell us about the sixteenth century. Personally,
I felt a throb of excitement when at
last he turned away from the queer old
chamber in which we stood.</p>

<p>“Well, come on!” he said, “I suppose
we must see this chap and clear things up.
Didn’t she say the morning-room?”</p>

<p>He seemed to know where that was well
enough, and led the way straight to it; its
door was slightly open, and as Parslewe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
threw it wide we became aware of Sir
Charles, posted on the hearth, his large face
turned expectantly towards us. Its expression
was severe, pompous, and non-committal,
but it changed with startling rapidity
as his eyes fell on Parslewe. He almost
jumped, indeed—moved, recovered himself,
gasped.</p>

<p>“God bless my soul!” he exclaimed. “My
dear sir, surely we have met before?”</p>

<p>Parslewe laughed sardonically.</p>

<p>“Aye, surely!” he answered, in his most
casual fashion. “Neither of us difficult to
recognise, I should think, Sir Charles. And
I understand you’ve met these young people
before, too?”</p>

<p>Sir Charles hastened to acknowledge us—perfunctorily;
it was evident that we were
very unimportant factors in the situation
compared to Parslewe, upon whom his eyes
were fastened with strange interest.</p>

<p>“I have had that pleasure,” he said. “But
you, my dear sir—we met, one night, some—is
it two, or is it three years ago?—at
the Crown, in our neighbouring town,
where, I believe, you are now staying? I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
remember our conversation—instructive and—and
enjoyable. Dear me! But I never
knew your name.”</p>

<p>“I knew yours,” said Parslewe, with a
grin. “That’s just why I wouldn’t see you
when you came to my house.”</p>

<p>Sir Charles stared—this was beyond him.
He looked from one to the other of us;
finally at Parslewe. There was that in his
expression which made me think that he was
wondering if Parslewe might not be a little
mad.</p>

<p>“But why, my good sir?” he asked
soothingly. “Why? Am I so——”</p>

<p>Parslewe laughed and pointed to the
panelling over the big fireplace. There,
carved in oak, was the Palkeney coat-of-arms,
and beneath it the motto that had
excited my wonder when I first saw it on the
copper box.</p>

<p>“Do you see that?” he asked. “Aye?—well,
you see, I have the Palkeney blood in
my veins! And what I please to do, that
I do!—without caring for or consulting
anybody. Family characteristic, Sperrigoe!
But I guess you’ve seen it before, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>Sir Charles was still staring at him. He
looked like a man who has unexpectedly
got hold of some curious animal and is
uncertain what it is about to do next. But
after rubbing his chin a little, he spoke.</p>

<p>“Do I understand you to say that you have
the Palkeney blood in your veins?” he
inquired. “Then——”</p>

<p>Parslewe suddenly pointed to the table
which stood in the centre of the room, signing
us all to be seated at it; I noticed that
he himself took the chair at its head as with
an unchallengeable authority.</p>

<p>“Better sit down and do our business,” he
said. Then, as we settled round the table,
Madrasia and I on his right and left hand,
and Sir Charles opposite to him, he put a
hand in his coat pocket, drew out the copper
box, and with one of his queer smiles, set it
before him. “Do you know what that is,
Sperrigoe?” he asked.</p>

<p>Sir Charles made a wry face.</p>

<p>“The cause of much worry and anxiety to
me, my dear sir!” he answered. “I can see
what it is well enough!”</p>

<p>“Aye, and you want to know how I got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
it, don’t you?” suggested Parslewe. “So do
these young people. I’ll tell you. Old
Matthew Palkeney made me a present of it.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Sir Charles. “You were
acquainted with him?”</p>

<p>“Don’t I tell you I’ve got Palkeney blood
in my veins?” said Parslewe. “My great-grandmother
was a Palkeney—born in this
house. I have the Palkeney pedigree, and
the Parslewe pedigree—at your service, any
time. And when I came to the Crown, on
the occasion you’ve just mentioned, it was
just out of curiosity to see this place. I introduced
myself to old Matthew. I’d brought
my pedigree with me; we compared notes and
family documents, and enjoyed ourselves. I
dined here with him one night, and we went
thoroughly into family history.”</p>

<p>“He was convinced of your relationship?”
asked Sir Charles.</p>

<p>“He couldn’t be anything else,” said
Parslewe, drily. “The thing’s there—it’s
fact. But we didn’t dwell overmuch on
that, once it was settled. We were more
concerned with our mutual taste for old
things. And the next day the old man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
drove up to the Crown, when I was out, and
left for me a parcel. It contained this
copper box, which has been in the family for
I don’t know how long, and some six or seven
old books which I had admired—a nice present.
I wrote him a nice letter in return, and
carried my present home. Not knowing,
mind you,” added Parslewe, with a sudden
keen look, “what this box contained.”</p>

<p>Sir Charles was getting keenly attentive.
He looked like a man who has become sure
that something is going to be sprung on him.</p>

<p>“My dear sir!” he said. “What did it
contain?”</p>

<p>Parslewe picked up the copper box and
tapped it significantly.</p>

<p>“I never knew that it contained anything
until some thirty-six hours ago!” he answered.
“I never should have known if you fellows
hadn’t made such a fuss about it. But when
you did—when I found out from Craye here
that you yourself were on the prowl, there
in Northumberland, and after me—well, I
naturally began to put two and two together.
And it seemed to me that the secret lay with
that man Bickerdale, to whom I’d entrusted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
the copper box for repair, and who’d had it
in his hands long enough to find out about it
more than I had. It struck me that Bickerdale,
not content with what he’d got out of
you for telling where the box was, had discovered
something in it which he was holding
back in hopes of a further and more
substantial reward. So I just went to Newcastle
and started to find that out. I did
find it out—and though I’m not clear now
as to when Bickerdale found a certain document
in the box, I did find out that he’d not
only found one, but had got it! And in
Craye’s presence and in the presence of your
man Pawley, to whom I’d just given a
certain piece of confidential information—I
forced it out of Bickerdale. I’ve got it!
And it solves the question that’s been bothering
you.”</p>

<p>Sir Charles was getting more and more
impatient; his plump white fingers were
drumming on the table. And as Parslewe
finished, he voiced his impatience in a quick,
direct question.</p>

<p>“What is this document?”</p>

<p>Parslewe smiled, and turned the copper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
box over, so that the four rounded feet at its
corners stood uppermost.</p>

<p>“I’ll show it to you now,” he said. “And
I’ll show you where old Matthew Palkeney
had hidden it, probably intending before he
died to tell you, Sperrigoe, where it was
hidden. Now look here; there’s a false
bottom to this box. You unscrew these
knobs so, one after the other. When they’re
unscrewed, like that, you lift this plate;
there’s a thin cavity between it and the inner
floor of the box. And here’s the document.
I put it back in the box so that you could
see for yourself where it had been concealed.”</p>

<p>He tossed over the table the envelope
which I had seen him take from Bickerdale.
The solicitor picked it up eagerly. He drew
out the sheet of letter paper which lay within,
and his sharp, shrewd eyes had read whatever
was written there in a few seconds. He
gave a gasp; his big face flushed; he looked
across at Parslewe.</p>

<p>“Good God, my dear sir!” he exclaimed.
“Do—do you know what this—what this—this
most important document—is?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>“I do!” replied Parslewe, drily. “But
these two don’t.”</p>

<p>Sir Charles turned to us. I think he found
some relief for his astonished feelings in
having somebody to announce something to.</p>

<p>“This—this is a will!” he said, in almost
awestruck accents. “The will of my late
client, Mr. Matthew Palkeney! Made by
himself on a single sheet of notepaper! But
in strict order, duly executed and attested. I
know the witnesses——”</p>

<p>“So do I,” observed Parslewe, with a laugh.
“Talked to both of ’em this morning on the
way here.”</p>

<p>“And—and, in short, it is what it is!”
continued Sir Charles. “Nothing can upset
it! And in it, in as few words as ever he
could use, Mr. Matthew Palkeney leaves
everything of which he dies possessed to—Mr.
Parslewe! Wonderful!”</p>

<p>Parslewe thrust his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything very wonderful
about it,” he remarked, coldly. “We were
of the same blood! The old man evidently
wanted to—and he did. But he never consulted
me, you know, Sperrigoe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>“All the more pleasant surprise for you,
my dear sir!” exclaimed Sir Charles. A new
mood appeared to have come over him;
after re-reading the will more attentively, he
rubbed his hands, chuckled, beamed on all
three of us, and seemed to have had a great
weight lifted off his mind. “My hearty
congratulations, sir!” he went on, with an
almost reverential inclination of his head
across the table. “A very, very handsome
property you have come into by this, Mr.
Parslewe! One of the most beautiful old
houses in England, a charming, if small
estate, and—yes, I should say, as a good
estimate, some five or six thousand a year!
Delightful!”</p>

<p>But Parslewe, leaning back in his chair,
with his hands thrust in his breeches pockets,
had set those thin lips of his. He looked over
the table at Sir Charles as if he were never
going to speak. But he spoke.</p>

<p>“Aye!” he said, in his driest, hardest
tones. “Just so! Maybe! But you see, I
don’t want it. And I won’t have it!”</p>

<p>A dead silence fell on us. Madrasia
turned wonderingly towards her guardian.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
I was already watching him. As for Sir
Charles Sperrigoe, he flushed crimson—as if
somebody had struck him an insulting blow.
He leaned forward.</p>

<p>“You—my dear sir, I am, I fear, inclining
to deafness,” he said. “Did I understand
you to say——”</p>

<p>“I said I don’t want it, and I won’t have
it!” repeated Parslewe, loudly. “I should
have told old Matthew that if he’d ever asked
me about it. I’m a man of fixed and immutable
principle. When I went out to India
as a young man, I made a vow that I’d never
own or take anything in this life that I didn’t
earn by my own effort, and I’ll stick to it!
I don’t want the Palkeney estate, nor the
Palkeney house, nor the Palkeney money—I’ve
plenty of money of my own, more than
I know what to do with, and a house that
suits me better than this does. If you want
to know me, look again at that motto! What
I please, that I’ll do! And I won’t have this—that’s
flat!”</p>

<p>Sir Charles’s astonished face regained its
normal colour, and he suddenly laughed with
genuine amusement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>“Dear, dear!” he said. “There is no doubt,
my dear sir, of your Palkeney blood—the
Palkeneys were always eccentric. But—you’re
forgetting something; a very pertinent
something. This place is yours! Yours!
Everything’s yours! I think I should put my—rather
rash and hasty—vow in my pocket,
my dear sir!”</p>

<p>Parslewe’s lips became tight again. But
they presently relaxed, and he bent forward
to the table again, and began to smile.</p>

<p>“If this place and the whole thing is mine,
absolutely and entirely,” he said in honeyed
accent, “I reckon I can do just what I like
with it, what?”</p>

<p>“There’s no man can say you nay!”
answered Sir Charles. “It’s—yours!”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll tell you what,” said Parslewe,
with one of his beautiful smiles and a wave
of his hand. “I’ll give it to these two young
people! They’re just suited to each other,
and it’ll fit their tastes like a glove. They
can get married at once, and settle down here,
and I’ll come and see them sometimes, and
they can come and see me sometimes at
Kelpieshaw. That’s the best way I can see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
out of the difficulty. We’ll settle it on them
and their children——”</p>

<p>But by this time Madrasia’s cheeks were
aflame, and she turned on Parslewe with
blazing eyes.</p>

<p>“Jimmie!” she exclaimed. “How—how
dare you? When will you give up that
wicked habit of settling other people’s affairs
as if—as if they were so many puppets?
Why—why—Mr. Craye has never even asked
me to marry him!”</p>

<p>Parslewe turned the full force of his
grimmest smile on us.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear!” he retorted leisurely.
“It’s his own fault if he hasn’t! I’m sure he’s
had plenty of opportunity. But——”</p>

<p>Sir Charles rose to the occasion. He rose
literally from his chair, bending towards
Parslewe; he even allowed himself to indulge
in a slight wink at Parslewe.</p>

<p>“My dear sir!” he cooed. “I think—er—if
we left our young friends together, my
dear sir! A little—er—informal conversation
between them—eh?—while you and I—shall
we try a glass of the famous Palkeney<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
dry sherry in another apartment, my dear sir?
Just so—just so——”</p>

<p>In another moment he had coaxed Parslewe
out of the room; the door closed on them.
Madrasia and I, seated at opposite sides of
the table, stared at each other. It seemed a
long time before I found my tongue.</p>

<p>“Madrasia!” I managed to say at last.
“Madrasia!”</p>

<p>“Well?” she answered.</p>

<p>“Madrasia!” I continued. “This is absolutely
awful! You know what your guardian
is!—a dreadful man. Nothing will prevent
him from having his own way about—about
anything! Whether we like it or not, he’ll
go and do what—what he said he would do
just now.”</p>

<p>Madrasia looked down at the table, and
began to study the pattern of the cloth.</p>

<p>“Well?” she said.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s at all well,” said I.
“Supposing—just supposing, you know—supposing
we fell in with his wishes and—and
got married. I’m just supposing, of
course!”</p>

<p>“Well?” she said, again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>“Don’t you see what a dreadful thing that
would be?” I said.</p>

<p>She gave me a quick flash of her eye—there,
and gone in a second.</p>

<p>“Why?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“People would say I married you for
your money,” I declared boldly. “That
would be awful for both of us!”</p>

<p>She remained silent a moment, tracing the
pattern of the cloth with the tip of her finger.
Then she spoke—emphatically.</p>

<p>“Rot!” she said.</p>

<p>“No!” said I, with equal emphasis.
“Because they would! I know ’em! And
it’s beastly hard on me; it upsets my plans.
Parslewe’s upset all my plans. If I’d only
known——”</p>

<p>“Only known what?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Only known that he was going to spring
this on us!” I answered, bitterly. “If I’d
only known that, I’d—I’d have——”</p>

<p>“You’d have what?” she asked, as I paused
and hesitated.</p>

<p>“Well—I’d have proposed to you this
morning when we were in the hotel garden,
or in that carriage, or in the wood, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
Parslewe was ahead,” I answered. “Or yesterday,
or the day before, or the day before
that—any time since I first met you. But
now—wouldn’t it look as if I were proposing
to the Palkeney estate?”</p>

<p>She suddenly looked up, gave me a queer
glance, and rising from her chair walked
over to one of the embrasured windows. I
followed her—and after a moment’s silence,
slipped my arm round her waist.</p>

<p>“What on earth’s to be done?” I asked
her. “Tell me!”</p>

<p>I got her to look round at last.</p>

<p>“You’re an awful old ass!” she said in a
whisper. “I saw the way out at once. He
didn’t say he’d give all this to <i>me</i>! He said
he’d give it to—<i>us</i>!”</p>

<p>“Is it going to be—us, then?” I demanded
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Seems very like it, I think, doesn’t it?” she
answered, demurely.</p>

<p>So—but not for a little while—we went to
tell Parslewe.</p>
